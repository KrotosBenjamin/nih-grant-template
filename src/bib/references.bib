	abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium (Ca(2+)) channels are key transducers of membrane potential changes into intracellular Ca(2+) transients that initiate many physiological events. There are ten members of the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel family in mammals, and they serve distinct roles in cellular signal transduction. The Ca(V)1 subfamily initiates contraction, secretion, regulation of gene expression, integration of synaptic input in neurons, and synaptic transmission at ribbon synapses in specialized sensory cells. The Ca(V)2 subfamily is primarily responsible for initiation of synaptic transmission at fast synapses. The Ca(V)3 subfamily is important for repetitive firing of action potentials in rhythmically firing cells such as cardiac myocytes and thalamic neurons. This article presents the molecular relationships and physiological functions of these Ca(2+) channel proteins and provides information on their molecular, genetic, physiological, and pharmacological properties.},

	abstract = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected {RNAs} or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here we use single-cell {RNA} sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells ({BMDCs}) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger {RNA} abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by {RNA}-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of {BMDCs}; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell {RNA}-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

We provide evidence that many heritable variations in gene function–such as burst size, burst frequency, cell cycle-specific expression and expression correlation/noise between cells–are masked when expression is averaged over many cells. Our results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression.},

To clarify the overall picture of interspecific gene flow among prokaryotes, we developed a new method for detecting horizontally transferred genes and their possible donors by Bayesian inference with training models for nucleotide composition. Our method gives the average posterior probability (horizontal transfer index) for each gene sequence, with a low horizontal transfer index indicating recent horizontal transfer. We found that 14\% of open reading frames in 116 prokaryotic complete genomes were subjected to recent horizontal transfer. Based on this data set, we quantitatively determined that the biological functions of horizontally transferred genes, except mobile element genes, are biased to three categories: cell surface, {DNA} binding and pathogenicity-related functions. Thus, the transferability of genes seems to depend heavily on their functions.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, studies of genes and genomes are indicating that considerable horizontal transfer has occurred between prokaryotes. Extensive horizontal transfer has occurred for operational genes (those involved in housekeeping), whereas informational genes (those involved in transcription, translation, and related processes) are seldomly horizontally transferred. Through phylogenetic analysis of six complete prokaryotic genomes and the identification of 312 sets of orthologous genes present in all six genomes, we tested two theories describing the temporal flow of horizontal transfer. We show that operational genes have been horizontally transferred continuously since the divergence of the prokaryotes, rather than having been exchanged in one, or a few, massive events that occurred early in the evolution of prokaryotes. In agreement with earlier studies, we found that differences in rates of evolution between operational and informational genes are minimal, suggesting that factors other than rate of evolution are responsible for the observed differences in horizontal transfer. We propose that a major factor in the more frequent horizontal transfer of operational genes is that informational genes are typically members of large, complex systems, whereas operational genes are not, thereby making horizontal transfer of informational gene products less probable (the complexity hypothesis).},

Traditionally, successful horizontal gene transfer was assumed to provide a selective advantage to either the host or the gene itself, but could horizontally transferred genes be neutral or nearly neutral? We suggest that for many prokaryotes, the boundaries between species are fuzzy, and therefore the principles of population genetics must be broadened so that they can be applied to higher taxonomic categories.},

Here, we present a comprehensive X-inactivation profile of the human X chromosome, representing an estimated 95\% of assayable genes in fibroblast-based test systems. In total, about 15\% of X-linked genes escape inactivation to some degree, and the proportion of genes escaping inactivation differs dramatically between different regions of the X chromosome, reflecting the evolutionary history of the sex chromosomes. An additional 10\% of X-linked genes show variable patterns of inactivation and are expressed to different extents from some inactive X chromosomes.

	abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and {RNA} samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

While ribosomal protein genes strongly place Thermotogales as a sister group to Aquificales, the majority of genes with sufficient phylogenetic signal show affinities to Archaea and Firmicutes, especially Clostridia. Indeed, on the basis of the majority of genes in their genomes (including genes that are also found in Aquificales), Thermotogales should be considered members of the Firmicutes. This result highlights the conflict between the taxonomic goal of assigning every species to a unique position in an inclusive Linnaean hierarchy and the evolutionary goal of understanding phylogenesis in the presence of pervasive horizontal gene transfer ({HGT}) within prokaryotes. Amino acid compositions of reconstructed ancestral sequences from 423 gene families suggest an origin of this gene pool even more thermophilic than extant members of this order, followed by adaptation to lower growth temperatures within the Thermotogales.},

This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate.

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. {RESULTS}: The value of {NGS} read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks.

	abstract = {Compelling evidence indicates that the long (D2L) and the short (D2S) isoform of dopamine ({DA}) D2 receptors serve distinct physiological functions in vivo. To address the involvement of these isoforms in the control of synaptic transmission in the striatum, we measured the sensitivity to D2 receptor stimulation of glutamate- and {GABA}-mediated currents recorded from striatal neurons of three mutant mice, in which the expression of D2L and D2S receptors was either ablated or variably altered. Our data indicate that both isoforms participate in the presynaptic inhibition of {GABA} transmission in the striatum, while the D2-receptor-dependent modulation of glutamate release preferentially involves the D2S receptor. Accordingly, the inhibitory effects of the {DA} D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (10 {microM}) on {GABA}(A)-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents ({IPSCs})correlate with the total number of D2 receptor sites in the striatum, irrespective of the specific receptor isoform expressed. In contrast, glutamate-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ({EPSCs}) were significantly inhibited by quinpirole only when the total number of D2 receptor sites, normally composed by both D2L and D2S receptors in a ratio favoring the D2L isoform, was modified to express only the D2S isoform at higher than normal levels. Understanding the physiological roles of {DA} D2 receptors in the striatum is essential for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.},

We find that ∼90\% of causal variants are non-coding, with ∼60\% mapping to immune-cell enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer-associated {RNA} upon immune stimulation. Causal variants tend to occur near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10-20\% directly alter recognizable transcription factor binding motifs. Rather, most non-coding risk variants, including those that alter gene expression, affect non-canonical sequence determinants not well-explained by current gene regulatory models.},

To address this question, we developed a method to amplify genomes of single neurons from human brains.

While we find somatic L1 insertions, we estimate {\textbackslash}textless 0.6 unique somatic insertions per neuron, and most neurons lack detectable somatic insertions, suggesting that L1 is not a major generator of neuronal diversity in cortex and caudate. We then genotyped single cortical cells to characterize the mosaicism of a somatic {AKT}3 mutation identified in a child with hemimegalencephaly.

We found a layer I interneuron expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by Itpr2.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The authors conducted a meta-analysis of relevant data from primary studies of the genetic epidemiology of major depression. {METHOD}: The authors searched {MEDLINE} and the reference lists of previous review articles to identify relevant primary studies. On the basis of a review of family, adoption, and twin studies that met specific inclusion criteria, the authors derived quantitative summary statistics. {RESULTS}: Five family studies met the inclusion criteria. The odds ratios for proband (subjects with major depression or comparison subjects) versus first-degree relative status (affected or unaffected with major depression) were homogeneous across the five studies (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio=2.84, 95\% {CI}=2.31-3.49). No adoption study met the inclusion criteria, but the results of two of the three reports were consistent with genetic influences on liability to major depression. Five twin studies met the inclusion criteria, and their statistical summation suggested that familial aggregation was due to additive genetic effects (point estimate of heritability of liability=37\%, 95\% {CI}=31\%-42\%), with a minimal contribution of environmental effects common to siblings (point estimate=0\%, 95\% {CI}=0\%-5\%), and substantial individual-specific environmental effects/measurement error (point estimate=63\%, 95\% {CI}=58\%-67\%). The literature suggests that recurrence best predicts the familial aggregation of major depression. {CONCLUSIONS}: Major depression is a familial disorder, and its familiality mostly or entirely results from genetic influences. Environmental influences specific to an individual are also etiologically significant. Major depression is a complex disorder that does not result from either genetic or environmental influences alone but rather from both. These findings are notably consistent across samples and methods and are likely to be generally applicable.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput {PCR} data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for {RNA}-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both {RNA}-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2015.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature. {RESULTS}: We present {featureCounts}, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either {RNA} or genomic {DNA} sequencing experiments. {featureCounts} implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: {featureCounts} is available under {GNU} General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.},

We identified 14 ancestral population clusters in Africa that correlate with self-described ethnicity and shared cultural and/or linguistic properties. We observed high levels of mixed ancestry in most populations, reflecting historical migration events across the continent. Our data also provide evidence for shared ancestry among geographically diverse hunter-gatherer populations (Khoesan speakers and Pygmies). The ancestry of African Americans is predominantly from Niger-Kordofanian (approximately 71\%), European (approximately 13\%), and other African (approximately 8\%) populations, although admixture levels varied considerably among individuals.

In addition, men and women are differentially vulnerable to stress-related pathologies, which have led to the hypothesis that the stress response circuitry differs depending on sex. The authors used the genetic tractability of Drosophila to manipulate pre- or postsynaptic dopamine signaling in transgenic animals, which were assayed for several parameters of locomotion and heart rate following exposure to 2 environmental stressors: starvation and oxidative stress. Their results show significant differences in the stress response for males and females by analyzing heart rate, centering time, and high mobility in addition to other locomotor parameters with translational relevance. These data demonstrate that both pre- and postsynaptic neurons are differentially recruited into the dopaminergic stress response circuitry for males and females. The results also show that the response circuits differ depending on the stressor and behavioral output. Furthermore, the authors' studies provide a translatable Drosophila model for further elucidation of factors involved in the sexually dimorphic recruitment of neurons into the stress response circuitry. 2013 {APA}, all rights reserved},

We used a systems biology approach to investigate in male rats the interaction of the ancestral modifications carried transgenerationally in the germ line and the proximate modifications involving chronic restraint stress during adolescence. We find that a single exposure to a common-use fungicide (vinclozolin) three generations removed alters the physiology, behavior, metabolic activity, and transcriptome in discrete brain nuclei in descendant males, causing them to respond differently to chronic restraint stress. This alteration of baseline brain development promotes a change in neural genomic activity that correlates with changes in physiology and behavior, revealing the interaction of genetics, environment, and epigenetic transgenerational inheritance in the shaping of the adult phenotype. This is an important demonstration in an animal that ancestral exposure to an environmental compound modifies how descendants of these progenitor individuals perceive and respond to a stress challenge experienced during their own life history.},

Rather, these kinds of responses, which we call 'predictive adaptive responses' ({PARs}), act primarily to improve fitness at a later stage of development. We argue that {PARs} have had an important role in human evolution, and that their recognition and interpretation has major significance for public health.},

Computational models have been good at simulating properties of the system, but are typically divorced from the underlying neural architecture. In this article we propose a new model which re-addresses response selection at the level of the basal ganglia. At the core of this response selection system the D1 {DA} receptor-expressing striatal pathways 'prepare' the set of possible appropriate responses. The D2DR-expressing striatal pathways then shape and 'select' from this initial response set framework. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Ventral Tegmentum \& Dopamine.

	abstract = {Gene duplication followed by neo- or sub-functionalization deeply impacts the evolution of protein families and is regarded as the main source of adaptive functional novelty in eukaryotes. While there is ample evidence of adaptive gene duplication in prokaryotes, it is not clear whether duplication outweighs the contribution of horizontal gene transfer in the expansion of protein families. We analyzed closely related prokaryote strains or species with small genomes (Helicobacter, Neisseria, Streptococcus, Sulfolobus), average-sized genomes (Bacillus, Enterobacteriaceae), and large genomes (Pseudomonas, Bradyrhizobiaceae) to untangle the effects of duplication and horizontal transfer. After removing the effects of transposable elements and phages, we show that the vast majority of expansions of protein families are due to transfer, even among large genomes. Transferred genes–xenologs–persist longer in prokaryotic lineages possibly due to a higher/longer adaptive role. On the other hand, duplicated genes–paralogs–are expressed more, and, when persistent, they evolve slower. This suggests that gene transfer and gene duplication have very different roles in shaping the evolution of biological systems: transfer allows the acquisition of new functions and duplication leads to higher gene dosage. Accordingly, we show that paralogs share most protein-protein interactions and genetic regulators, whereas xenologs share very few of them. Prokaryotes invented most of life's biochemical diversity. Therefore, the study of the evolution of biology systems should explicitly account for the predominant role of horizontal gene transfer in the diversification of protein families.},

	abstract = {The biosynthesis of quinolinate, the de novo precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ({NAD}), may be performed by two distinct pathways, namely, the bacterial aspartate (aspartate-to-quinolinate) and the eukaryotic kynurenine (tryptophan-to-quinolinate). Even though the separation into eukaryotic and bacterial routes is long established, recent genomic surveys have challenged this view, because certain bacterial species also carry the genes for the kynurenine pathway. In this work, both quinolinate biosynthetic pathways were investigated in the Bacteria clade and with special attention to Xanthomonadales and Bacteroidetes, from an evolutionary viewpoint. Genomic screening has revealed that a small number of bacterial species possess some of the genes for the kynurenine pathway, which is complete in the genus Xanthomonas and in the order Flavobacteriales, where the aspartate pathway is absent. The opposite pattern (presence of the aspartate pathway and absence of the kynurenine pathway) in close relatives (Xylella ssp. and the order Bacteroidales, respectively) points to the idea of a recent acquisition of the kynurenine pathway through lateral gene transfer in these bacterial groups. In fact, sequence similarity comparison and phylogenetic reconstruction both suggest that at least part of the genes of the kynurenine pathway in Xanthomonas and Flavobacteriales is shared by eukaryotes. These results reinforce the idea of the role that lateral gene transfer plays in the configuration of bacterial genomes, thereby providing alternative metabolic pathways, even with the replacement of primary and essential cell functions, as exemplified by {NAD} biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {The population persistence of schizophrenia despite associated reductions in fitness and fecundity suggests that the genetic basis of schizophrenia has a complex evolutionary history. A recent meta-analysis of schizophrenia genome-wide association studies offers novel opportunities for assessment of the evolutionary trajectories of schizophrenia-associated loci. In this study, we hypothesize that components of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia are attributable to human lineage-specific evolution. Our results suggest that schizophrenia-associated loci enrich in genes near previously identified human accelerated regions ({HARs}). Specifically, we find that genes near {HARs} conserved in nonhuman primates ({pHARs}) are enriched for schizophrenia-associated loci, and that {pHAR}-associated schizophrenia genes are under stronger selective pressure than other schizophrenia genes and other {pHAR}-associated genes. We further evaluate {pHAR}-associated schizophrenia genes in regulatory network contexts to investigate associated molecular functions and mechanisms. We find that {pHAR}-associated schizophrenia genes significantly enrich in a {GABA}-related coexpression module that was previously found to be differentially regulated in schizophrenia affected individuals versus healthy controls. In another two independent networks constructed from gene expression profiles from prefrontal cortex samples, we find that {pHAR}-associated schizophrenia genes are located in more central positions and their average path lengths to the other nodes are significantly shorter than those of other schizophrenia genes. Together, our results suggest that {HARs} are associated with potentially important functional roles in the genetic architecture of schizophrenia. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author 2015.

Microarray analyses indicated that genes associated with canonical cell cycle pathways were significantly affected in the anterior cingulate gyrus ({ACG}), the region exhibiting the most profound myelin-specific gene expression changes, in persons with {SZ} (N=16) as compared with controls (N=19). Detected gene expression changes of key regulators of G1/S phase transition and genes central to oligodendrocyte differentiation were validated using {qPCR} in the {ACG} in an independent cohort (Ns=45/34). The relative abundance of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein ({pRb}) was increased in the white matter underlying the {ACG} in {SZ} subjects (Ns=12). The upregulation of cyclin D1 gene expression and the downregulation of p57(Kip2), accompanied by increased cyclin D/{CDK}4-dependent phosphorylation of {pRb}, acting as a checkpoint for G1/S phase transition, suggest abnormal cell cycle re-entry in postmitotic oligodendrocytes in {SZ}. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of brain samples from myelin mutant animal models, quaking and myelin-associated glycoprotein ({MAG}) null mice, showed that cell cycle gene expression changes were not a necessary consequence of the reduced gene expression of structural myelin proteins, such as {MAG}. While, quaking, a known modulator of cell cycle activity during oligodendrocyte differentiation impairs the expression of multiple myelin genes, including those that are affected in {SZ}. These data suggest that the normal patterns of cell cycle gene and protein expression are disrupted in {SZ} and that this disruption may contribute to the oligodendroglial deficits observed in {SZ}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Selection of relevant genes for sample classification is a common task in most gene expression studies, where researchers try to identify the smallest possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance (for instance, for future use with diagnostic purposes in clinical practice). Many gene selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene) rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds to select the number of genes, can only be applied to two-class problems, and use gene selection ranking criteria unrelated to the classification algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance. Thus, it is important to understand the performance of random forest with microarray data and its possible use for gene selection. {RESULTS}: We investigate the use of random forest for classification of microarray data (including multi-class problems) and propose a new method of gene selection in classification problems based on random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray data sets we show that random forest has comparable performance to other classification methods, including {DLDA}, {KNN}, and {SVM}, and that the new gene selection procedure yields very small sets of genes (often smaller than alternative methods) while preserving predictive accuracy. {CONCLUSION}: Because of its performance and features, random forest and gene selection using random forest should probably become part of the "standard tool-box" of methods for class prediction and gene selection with microarray data.},

We found that, among well-studied indications, the proportion of drug mechanisms with direct genetic support increases significantly across the drug development pipeline, from 2.0\% at the preclinical stage to 8.2\% among mechanisms for approved drugs, and varies dramatically among disease areas. We estimate that selecting genetically supported targets could double the success rate in clinical development.

In addition to de novo spliced alignment, {TopHat}2 can align reads across fusion breaks, which can occur after genomic translocations. {TopHat}2 combines the ability to identify novel splice sites with direct mapping to known transcripts, producing sensitive and accurate alignments, even for highly repetitive genomes or in the presence of pseudogenes. {TopHat}2 is available at http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The study of cancer genomes now routinely involves using next-generation sequencing technology ({NGS}) to profile tumours for single nucleotide variant ({SNV}) somatic mutations. However, surprisingly few published bioinformatics methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic mutations from {NGS} data and existing tools are often inaccurate, yielding intolerably high false prediction rates. As such, the computational problem of accurately inferring somatic mutations from paired tumour/normal {NGS} data remains an unsolved challenge. {RESULTS}: We present the comparison of four standard supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of somatic {SNV} prediction in tumour/normal {NGS} experiments. To evaluate these approaches (random forest, Bayesian additive regression tree, support vector machine and logistic regression), we constructed 106 features representing 3369 candidate somatic {SNVs} from 48 breast cancer genomes, originally predicted with naive methods and subsequently revalidated to establish ground truth labels. We trained the classifiers on this data (consisting of 1015 true somatic mutations and 2354 non-somatic mutation positions) and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these methods using a cross-validation framework and hold-out test {NGS} data from both exome capture and whole genome shotgun platforms. All learning algorithms employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature selection improved the predictive accuracy over standard approaches by statistically significant margins. In addition, using unsupervised clustering of the ground truth 'false positive' predictions, we noted several distinct classes and present evidence suggesting non-overlapping sources of technical artefacts illuminating important directions for future study. {AVAILABILITY}: Software called {MutationSeq} and datasets are available from http://compbio.bccrc.ca.},

Here, we integrate comparative genomics with flux balance analysis to examine (i) the contribution of different genetic mechanisms to network growth in bacteria, (ii) the selective forces driving network evolution and (iii) the integration of new nodes into the network. Most changes to the metabolic network of Escherichia coli in the past 100 million years are due to horizontal gene transfer, with little contribution from gene duplicates. Networks grow by acquiring genes involved in the transport and catalysis of external nutrients, driven by adaptations to changing environments. Accordingly, horizontally transferred genes are integrated at the periphery of the network, whereas central parts remain evolutionarily stable. Genes encoding physiologically coupled reactions are often transferred together, frequently in operons. Thus, bacterial metabolic networks evolve by direct uptake of peripheral reactions in response to changed environments.},

	abstract = {Lateral gene transfer ({LGT}), the acquisition of genes from other species, is a major evolutionary force. However, its success as an adaptive process makes the reconstruction of the history of life an intricate puzzle: If no gene has remained unaffected during the course of life's evolution, how can one rely on molecular markers to reconstruct the relationships among species? Here, we take a completely different look at {LGT} and its impact for the reconstruction of the history of life. Rather than trying to remove the effect of {LGT} in phylogenies, and ignoring as a result most of the information of gene histories, we use an explicit phylogenetic model of gene transfer to reconcile gene histories with the tree of species. We studied 16 bacterial and archaeal phyla, representing a dataset of 12,000 gene families distributed in 336 genomes. Our results show that, in most phyla, {LGT} provides an abundant phylogenetic signal on the pattern of species diversification and that this signal is robust to the choice of gene families under study. We also find that {LGT} brings an abundant signal on the location of the root of species trees, which has been previously overlooked. Our results quantify the great variety of gene transfer rates among lineages of the tree of life and provide strong support for the "complexity hypothesis," which states that genes whose products participate to macromolecular protein complexes are relatively resistant to transfer.},

We first estimated trait heritability, showing that it can be substantial, accounting for up to 87\% of the variance (mean 41\%). Next, by assessing ∼8.2 million variants that we identified and confirmed in an extended set of 2,870 individuals, 23 independent variants at 13 loci associated with at least one trait. Notably, variants at three loci ({HLA}, {IL}2RA, and {SH}2B3/{ATXN}2) overlap with known autoimmune disease associations.

Several neurotransmitters and hormones regulate native T-type calcium channels, although some contradictory data have been reported depending on the cell type studied. This review focuses on the short-term (minutes range) modulation of T-type calcium channels by neurotransmitters and hormones and on the roles of G proteins and protein kinases in these modulatory effects.

We used a newly developed single photon emission computerized tomography method to measure amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the striatum of fifteen patients with schizophrenia and fifteen healthy controls. Amphetamine-induced dopamine release was estimated by the amphetamine-induced reduction in dopamine D2 receptor availability, measured as the binding potential of the specific D2 receptor radiotracer [123I] (S)-(-)-3-iodo-2-hydroxy-6-methoxy-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) methyl]benzamide ([123I]{IBZM}). The amphetamine-induced decrease in [123I]{IBZM} binding potential was significantly greater in the schizophrenic group (-19.5 +/- 4.1\%) compared with the control group (-7.6 +/- 2.1\%). In the schizophrenic group, elevated amphetamine effect on [123I]{IBZM} binding potential was associated with emergence or worsening of positive psychotic symptoms. This result suggests that psychotic symptoms elicited in this experimental setting in schizophrenic patients are associated with exaggerated stimulation of dopaminergic transmission. Such an observation would be compatible with an abnormal responsiveness of dopaminergic neurons in schizophrenia.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed {PLINK}, an open-source C/C++ {WGAS} tool set. With {PLINK}, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, {PLINK} also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce {PLINK} and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

At least 50 per cent of the human genome is derived from retrotransposons, with three active families (L1, Alu and {SVA}) associated with insertional mutagenesis and disease. Epigenetic and post-transcriptional suppression block retrotransposition in somatic cells, excluding early embryo development and some malignancies. Recent reports of L1 expression and copy number variation in the human brain suggest that L1 mobilization may also occur during later development. However, the corresponding integration sites have not been mapped. Here we apply a high-throughput method to identify numerous L1, Alu and {SVA} germline mutations, as well as 7,743 putative somatic L1 insertions, in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus of three individuals. Surprisingly, we also found 13,692 somatic Alu insertions and 1,350 {SVA} insertions. Our results demonstrate that retrotransposons mobilize to protein-coding genes differentially expressed and active in the brain. Thus, somatic genome mosaicism driven by retrotransposition may reshape the genetic circuitry that underpins normal and abnormal neurobiological processes. {\textbackslash}copyright2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Moreover, we demonstrate that Gomafu binds directly to the splicing factors {QKI} and {SRSF}1 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1) and dysregulation of Gomafu leads to alternative splicing patterns that resemble those observed in {SZ} for the archetypal {SZ}-associated genes {DISC}1 and {ERBB}4. Finally, we show that Gomafu is downregulated in post-mortem cortical gray matter from the superior temporal gyrus in {SZ}. These results functionally link activity-regulated {lncRNAs} and alternative splicing in neuronal function and suggest that their dysregulation may contribute to neurological disorders.},

In modern organisms we suggest that both the range and frequencies of {HGT} are constrained most often by selective barriers. As a consequence those {HGT} events that do occur most often have little influence on genome phylogeny. Although {HGT} does occur with important evolutionary consequences, classical Darwinian lineages seem to be the dominant mode of evolution for modern organisms.},

	abstract = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date have used the {HapMap} as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple {SNP} chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of {SNPs} to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method ({IMPUTE} version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that {IMPUTE} v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the {HapMap} provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that {IMPUTE} v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common {SNPs}, with overall error rates that are 15\%-20\% lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of {SNPs}; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions.},

	abstract = {Analysis of expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) provides a means for detecting transcriptional regulatory relationships at a genome-wide scale. Here we explain the {eQTL} analysis pipeline, we introduce publicly available tools for the statistical analysis, and we discuss issues that might complicate the {eQTL} mapping process. The detection and interpretation of {eQTL} requires careful consideration of a range of potentially confounding effects. Particularly population substructure and batch effects may lead to the detection of many false-positive {eQTL} if not accounted for. Traditionally, most {eQTL} mapping methods only check for the correlation of single loci with gene expression. In order to detect (epistatic) interactions between distant genetic loci one has to take into account several loci simultaneously. Here, we present the Random Forest regression method as a way of accounting for interacting loci. Next, we introduce analysis methods aiding the biological interpretation of detected {eQTL}. For example, the notion of local (cis) and distant (trans) {eQTL} has been very useful for interpreting the causes and implications of {eQTL} in many studies. In addition, Bayesian networks have been used extensively to infer causal relationships among {eQTL} and between {eQTL} and other genetic associations (e.g. disease associated loci). Also, the integration of {eQTL} with complementary information such as physical protein interaction data may significantly improve statistical power and provide insight into possible molecular mechanisms linking the regulator to its target gene. The {eQTL} approach is potentially very powerful for the analysis of regulatory pathways affecting disease susceptibility and other relevant traits. However, careful analysis is required to unleash its full potential.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Despite the importance of dopamine neurotransmission in schizophrenia, very few studies have addressed anomalies in the mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area ({SN}/{VTA}). Tyrosine hydroxylase ({TH}) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of dopamine, and a possible contributor to the anomalies in the dopaminergic neurotransmission observed in schizophrenia. {OBJECTIVES}: In this study, we had three objectives: (1) Compare {TH} expression ({mRNA} and protein) in the {SN}/{VTA} of schizophrenia and control postmortem samples. (2) Assess the effect of antipsychotic medications on the expression of {TH} in the {SN}/{VTA}. (3) Examine possible regional differences in {TH} expression anomalies within the {SN}/{VTA}. {METHODS}: To achieve these objectives three independent studies were conducted: (1) A pilot study to compare {TH} {mRNA} and {TH} protein levels in the {SN}/{VTA} of postmortem samples from schizophrenia and controls. (2) A chronic treatment study was performed in rodents to assess the effect of antipsychotic medications in {TH} protein levels in the {SN}/{VTA}. (3) A second postmortem study was performed to assess {TH} and phosphorylated {TH} protein levels in two types of samples: schizophrenia and control samples containing the entire rostro-caudal extent of the {SN}/{VTA}, and schizophrenia and control samples containing only mid-caudal regions of the {SN}/{VTA}. {RESULTS} {AND} {CONCLUSION}: Our studies showed impairment in the dopaminergic system in schizophrenia that could be mainly (or exclusively) located in the rostral region of the {SN}/{VTA}. Our studies also showed that {TH} protein levels were significantly abnormal in schizophrenia, while {mRNA} expression levels were not affected, indicating that {TH} pathology in this region may occur posttranscriptionally. Lastly, our antipsychotic animal treatment study showed that {TH} protein levels were not significantly affected by antipsychotic treatment, indicating that these anomalies are an intrinsic pathology rather than a treatment effect.},

In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" ({SVA}) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. {SVA} can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply {SVA} to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies.

Optionally, these factors can be interpreted as pathway or transcription factor activations by providing prior information about which genes are involved in the pathway or targeted by the factor. The inferred factors are used in genetic association analyses. First, they are treated as additional covariates, and are included in the model to increase detection power for mapping expression traits. Second, they are analyzed as phenotypes themselves to understand the causes of global expression variability. {PEER} extends previous related surrogate variable models and can be implemented within hours on a desktop computer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis ({WGCNA}) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. {RESULTS}: The {WGCNA} R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. {CONCLUSION}: The {WGCNA} package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {DNA} methylation has been recognized as a key mechanism in cell differentiation. Various studies have compared tissues to characterize epigenetically regulated genomic regions, but due to differences in study design and focus there still is no consensus as to the annotation of genomic regions predominantly involved in tissue-specific methylation. We used a new algorithm to identify and annotate tissue-specific differentially methylated regions ({tDMRs}) from Illumina 450k chip data for four peripheral tissues (blood, saliva, buccal swabs and hair follicles) and six internal tissues (liver, muscle, pancreas, subcutaneous fat, omentum and spleen with matched blood samples). {RESULTS}: The majority of {tDMRs}, in both relative and absolute terms, occurred in {CpG}-poor regions. Further analysis revealed that these regions were associated with alternative transcription events (alternative first exons, mutually exclusive exons and cassette exons). Only a minority of {tDMRs} mapped to gene-body {CpG} islands (13\%) or {CpG} islands shores (25\%) suggesting a less prominent role for these regions than indicated previously. Implementation of {ENCODE} annotations showed enrichment of {tDMRs} in {DNase} hypersensitive sites and transcription factor binding sites. Despite the predominance of tissue differences, inter-individual differences in {DNA} methylation in internal tissues were correlated with those for blood for a subset of {CpG} sites in a locus- and tissue-specific manner. {CONCLUSIONS}: We conclude that {tDMRs} preferentially occur in {CpG}-poor regions and are associated with alternative transcription. Furthermore, our data suggest the utility of creating an atlas cataloguing variably methylated regions in internal tissues that correlate to {DNA} methylation measured in easy accessible peripheral tissues.},

This inherent imperfectness leads to the generation of damage by every biological process, at all levels, from small molecules to cells. The damage is too numerous to be repaired, is partially invisible to natural selection, and manifests as aging. I propose that the inherent imperfectness of biological systems is the true root of the aging process. Because each biomolecule generates specific forms of damage, the cumulative damage is largely non-random and is indirectly encoded in the genome. I consider this concept in light of other proposed theories of aging and integrate these disparate ideas into a single model. I also discuss the evolutionary significance of damage accumulation and strategies for reducing damage. Finally, I suggest ways to test this integrated model of aging.

Once a genome is sequenced, {SnpEff} annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of {SnpEff} is illustrated by annotating ∼356,660 candidate {SNPs} in ∼117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of ∼1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that ∼15,842 {SNPs} are synonymous and ∼4,467 {SNPs} are non-synonymous (N/S ∼0.28). The remaining {SNPs} are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 {SNPs}), stop codon losses (8 {SNPs}), and start codon gains (297 {SNPs}) in the 5'{UTR}. We found, as expected, that the {SNP} frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost {SNPs} in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3' {UTRs} are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, {SnpEff} enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory.},

We previously demonstrated that engineered human L1s can retrotranspose in adult rat hippocampus progenitor cells in vitro and in the mouse brain in vivo. Here we demonstrate that neural progenitor cells isolated from human fetal brain and derived from human embryonic stem cells support the retrotransposition of engineered human L1s in vitro. Furthermore, we developed a quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction that detected an increase in the copy number of endogenous L1s in the hippocampus, and in several regions of adult human brains, when compared to the copy number of endogenous L1s in heart or liver genomic {DNAs} from the same donor. These data suggest that de novo L1 retrotransposition events may occur in the human brain and, in principle, have the potential to contribute to individual somatic mosaicism.},

In addition, activation and inactivation of dopamine neurons regulate mood and induce reward and aversion, respectively. Accumulating evidence suggests that such motivational role of dopamine neurons is not limited to those located in the ventral tegmental area, but also in the substantia nigra. The present paper reviews previous rodent work concerning dopamine's role in approach motivation and the connectivity of dopamine neurons, and proposes two working models: One concerns the relationship between extracellular dopamine concentration and approach motivation. High, moderate and low concentrations of extracellular dopamine induce euphoric, seeking and aversive states, respectively. The other concerns circuit loops involving the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, epithalamus, and midbrain through which dopaminergic activity alters approach motivation. These models should help to generate hypothesis-driven research and provide insights for understanding altered states associated with drugs of abuse and affective disorders.

	abstract = {Cell-lineage-specific transcripts are essential for differentiated tissue function, implicated in hereditary organ failure, and mediate acquired chronic diseases. However, experimental identification of cell-lineage-specific genes in a genome-scale manner is infeasible for most solid human tissues. We developed the first genome-scale method to identify genes with cell-lineage-specific expression, even in lineages not separable by experimental microdissection. Our machine-learning-based approach leverages high-throughput data from tissue homogenates in a novel iterative statistical framework. We applied this method to chronic kidney disease and identified transcripts specific to podocytes, key cells in the glomerular filter responsible for hereditary and most acquired glomerular kidney disease. In a systematic evaluation of our predictions by immunohistochemistry, our in silico approach was significantly more accurate (65\% accuracy in human) than predictions based on direct measurement of in vivo fluorescence-tagged murine podocytes (23\%). Our method identified genes implicated as causal in hereditary glomerular disease and involved in molecular pathways of acquired and chronic renal diseases. Furthermore, based on expression analysis of human kidney disease biopsies, we demonstrated that expression of the podocyte genes identified by our approach is significantly related to the degree of renal impairment in patients. Our approach is broadly applicable to define lineage specificity in both cell physiology and human disease contexts. We provide a user-friendly website that enables researchers to apply this method to any cell-lineage or tissue of interest. Identified cell-lineage-specific transcripts are expected to play essential tissue-specific roles in organogenesis and disease and can provide starting points for the development of organ-specific diagnostics and therapies.},

Results from polymerase chain reactions as well as in situ hybridization revealed that {mRNA} encoding both receptor forms is present in pituitary and brain of both rat and man. The larger form was predominant in these tissues and, as shown in the rat, expressed by dopaminergic and dopaminoceptive neurons. Analysis of the human gene showed that the additional peptide sequence is encoded by a separate exon. Hence, the two receptor forms are generated by differential splicing possibly to permit coupling to different G proteins. Both receptors expressed in cultured mammalian cells bind [3H]spiperone with high affinity and inhibit adenylyl cyclase, as expected of the D2 receptor subtype.},

They are, however, confounded by pre- and postmortem factors. The purpose of this study was to identify sources of variation that will enable a better design of gene expression studies and higher reliability of gene expression data. {METHODS}: We assessed the contribution of multiple variables to messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) expression of reference (housekeeping) genes measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) by multiple regression analysis in a large number (N = 143) of autopsy samples from the hippocampus and white and grey matter of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) of patients with schizophrenia and normal control subjects. {RESULTS}: The strongest predictor of gene expression was total {RNA} quality. Other significant factors included {pH}, postmortem interval, age and the duration of the agonal state, but the importance of these factors depended on transcript measured, brain region analyzed, and diagnosis. The quality of {RNA} obtained from the {DLPFC} white matter was also adversely affected by smoking. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results show that normalization of expression data of target genes with a geometric mean of multiple housekeeping genes should be used to control for differences in {RNA} quality between samples. The results also suggest that accurate assessment of other confounding factors and their inclusion as regressors in the analysis is critical for obtaining reliable and accurate quantification of {mRNA} expression.},

An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data. {AVAILABILITY}: The package is freely available under the {LGPL} licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).},

Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals.

The dopamine 1 receptor ({DRD}1) is thought to mediate some of the cognitive deficits in {SCZ}, including impairment of working memory that relies on normal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) function. To better understand the association of dopamine receptors with {SCZ}, we studied the expression of three {DRD}2 splice variants and the {DRD}1 transcript in {DLPFC}, hippocampus and caudate nucleus in a large cohort of subjects (∼700), including patients with {SCZ}, affective disorders and nonpsychiatric controls (from 14th gestational week to 85 years of age), and examined genotype-expression associations of 278 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) located in or near {DRD}2 and {DRD}1 genes. Expression of D2S {mRNA} and D2S/D2-long (D2L) ratio were significantly increased in {DLPFC} of patients with {SCZ} relative to controls (P{\textbackslash}textless 0.0001 and P{\textbackslash}textless 0.0001, respectively), whereas D2L, D2Longer and {DRD}1 were decreased (P{\textbackslash}textless 0.0001). Patients with affective disorders showed an opposite pattern: reduced expression of D2S (major depressive disorder, P{\textbackslash}textless 0.0001) and increased expression of D2L and {DRD}1 (bipolar disorder, P{\textbackslash}textless 0.0001). Moreover, {SCZ}-associated risk alleles at rs1079727, rs1076560 and rs2283265 predicted increased D2S/D2L expression ratio (P{\textbackslash}textless 0.05) in control individuals. Our data suggest that altered splicing of {DRD}2 and expression of {DRD}1 may constitute a pathophysiological mechanism in risk for {SCZ} and affective disorders. The association between {SCZ} risk-associated polymorphism and the ratio of D2S/D2L is consistent with this possibility.},

	abstract = {The aging brain is characterized by a shift from the homeostatic balance of inflammatory mediators to a proinflammatory state. This increase in neuroinflammation is marked by increased numbers of activated and primed microglia, increased steady-state levels of inflammatory cytokines and decreases in anti-inflammatory molecules. These conditions sensitize the aged brain to produce an exaggerated response to the presence of an immune stimulus in the periphery or following exposure to a stressor. In the brain, proinflammatory cytokines can have profound effects on behavioral and neural processes. As the aged brain is primed to respond to inflammatory stimuli, infection or stress may produce more severe detriments in cognitive function in the aged. Typically after an immune stimulus, aged animals display prolonged sickness behaviors, increased cytokine induction and greater cognitive impairments compared to adults. Additionally, aging can also augment the central response to stressors leading to exaggerated cytokine induction and increased decrements in learning and memory. This alteration in neuroinflammation and resultant sensitization to extrinsic and intrinsic stressors can have considerable effects upon the elderly's recovery and coping during disease and stress.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) have shown a large number of genetic variants to be associated with complex diseases. The identification of the causal variant within an associated locus can sometimes be difficult because of the linkage disequilibrium between the associated variants and because most {GWAS} loci contain multiple genes, or no genes at all. Expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}) mapping is a method used to determine the effects of genetic variants on gene expression levels. {eQTL} mapping studies have enabled the prioritization of genetic variants within {GWAS} loci, and have shown that trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) often function in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner, sometimes having downstream effects on completely different chromosomes. Furthermore, recent {RNA}-sequencing ({RNA}-seq) studies have shown that a large repertoire of transcripts is available in cells, which are actively regulated by (trait-associated) variants. Future {eQTL} mapping studies will focus on broadening the range of available tissues and cell types, in order to determine the key tissues and cell types involved in complex traits. Finally, large meta-analyses will be able to pinpoint the causal variants within the trait-associated loci and determine their downstream effects in greater detail.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) have enabled the discovery of common genetic variation contributing to normal and pathological traits and clinical drug responses, but recognizing the precise targets of these associations is now the major challenge. Here, we review recent approaches to the functional follow-up of {GWAS} loci, including fine mapping of {GWAS} signal(s), prioritization of putative functional {SNPs} by the integration of genetic epidemiological and bioinformatic methods, and in vitro and in vivo experimental verification of predicted molecular mechanisms for identifying the targeted genes. The majority of {GWAS}-identified variants fall in noncoding regions of the genome. Therefore, this review focuses on strategies for assessing likely mechanisms affected by noncoding variants; such mechanisms include transcriptional regulation, noncoding {RNA} function, and epigenetic regulation. These approaches have already accelerated progress from genetic studies to biological knowledge and might ultimately guide the development of prognostic, preventive, and therapeutic measures.

Four genes have been identified in mice–Spalt1 to Spalt4 (Sall1 to Sall4). Spalt homologues are widely expressed in neural and mesodermal tissues during early embryogenesis. Sall3 is normally expressed in mice from embryonic day 7 (E7) in the neural ectoderm and primitive streak and subsequently in the brain, peripheral nerves, spinal cord, limb buds, palate, heart, and otic vesicles. We have generated a targeted disruption of Sall3 in mice. Homozygous mutant animals die on the first postnatal day and fail to feed. Examination of the oral structures of these animals revealed that abnormalities were present in the palate and epiglottis from E16.5. In E10.5 embryos, deficiencies in cranial nerves that normally innervate oral structures, particularly the glossopharyngeal nerve ({IX}), were observed. These studies indicate that Sall3 is required for the development of nerves that are derived from the hindbrain and for the formation of adjacent branchial arch derivatives.},

	abstract = {Estimation of narrow-sense heritability, h(2), from genome-wide {SNPs} genotyped in unrelated individuals has recently attracted interest and offers several advantages over traditional pedigree-based methods. With the use of this approach, it has been estimated that over half the heritability of human height can be attributed to the ∼300,000 {SNPs} on a genome-wide genotyping array. In comparison, only 5\%-10\% can be explained by {SNPs} reaching genome-wide significance. We investigated via simulation the validity of several key assumptions underpinning the mixed-model analysis used in {SNP}-based h(2) estimation. Although we found that the method is reasonably robust to violations of four key assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to uneven linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) between {SNPs}: contributions to h(2) are overestimated from causal variants in regions of high {LD} and are underestimated in regions of low {LD}. The overall direction of the bias can be up or down depending on the genetic architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial in realistic scenarios. We propose a modified kinship matrix in which {SNPs} are weighted according to local {LD}. We show that this correction greatly reduces the bias and increases the precision of h(2) estimates. We demonstrate the impact of our method on the first seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Our {LD} adjustment revises downward the h(2) estimate for immune-related diseases, as expected because of high {LD} in the major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for some nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised kinship matrix, we developed {LDAK}, software for computing {LD}-adjusted kinships. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.

	abstract = {In many applications, one is interested in determining which of the properties of a network module change across conditions. For example, to validate the existence of a module, it is desirable to show that it is reproducible (or preserved) in an independent test network. Here we study several types of network preservation statistics that do not require a module assignment in the test network. We distinguish network preservation statistics by the type of the underlying network. Some preservation statistics are defined for a general network (defined by an adjacency matrix) while others are only defined for a correlation network (constructed on the basis of pairwise correlations between numeric variables). Our applications show that the correlation structure facilitates the definition of particularly powerful module preservation statistics. We illustrate that evaluating module preservation is in general different from evaluating cluster preservation. We find that it is advantageous to aggregate multiple preservation statistics into summary preservation statistics. We illustrate the use of these methods in six gene co-expression network applications including 1) preservation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in mouse tissues, 2) comparison of human and chimpanzee brain networks, 3) preservation of selected {KEGG} pathways between human and chimpanzee brain networks, 4) sex differences in human cortical networks, 5) sex differences in mouse liver networks. While we find no evidence for sex specific modules in human cortical networks, we find that several human cortical modules are less preserved in chimpanzees. In particular, apoptosis genes are differentially co-expressed between humans and chimpanzees. Our simulation studies and applications show that module preservation statistics are useful for studying differences between the modular structure of networks.

	abstract = {Polygenic scores have recently been used to summarise genetic effects among an ensemble of markers that do not individually achieve significance in a large-scale association study. Markers are selected using an initial training sample and used to construct a score in an independent replication sample by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles within each subject. Association between a trait and this composite score implies that a genetic signal is present among the selected markers, and the score can then be used for prediction of individual trait values. This approach has been used to obtain evidence of a genetic effect when no single markers are significant, to establish a common genetic basis for related disorders, and to construct risk prediction models. In some cases, however, the desired association or prediction has not been achieved. Here, the power and predictive accuracy of a polygenic score are derived from a quantitative genetics model as a function of the sizes of the two samples, explained genetic variance, selection thresholds for including a marker in the score, and methods for weighting effect sizes in the score. Expressions are derived for quantitative and discrete traits, the latter allowing for case/control sampling. A novel approach to estimating the variance explained by a marker panel is also proposed. It is shown that published studies with significant association of polygenic scores have been well powered, whereas those with negative results can be explained by low sample size. It is also shown that useful levels of prediction may only be approached when predictors are estimated from very large samples, up to an order of magnitude greater than currently available. Therefore, polygenic scores currently have more utility for association testing than predicting complex traits, but prediction will become more feasible as sample sizes continue to grow.},

Increased L1 was demonstrated in neurons from prefrontal cortex of patients and in induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cell-derived neurons containing 22q11 deletions. Whole-genome sequencing revealed brain-specific L1 insertion in patients localized preferentially to synapse- and schizophrenia-related genes. To study the mechanism of L1 transposition, we examined perinatal environmental risk factors for schizophrenia in animal models and observed an increased L1 copy number after immune activation by poly-I:C or epidermal growth factor. These findings suggest that hyperactive retrotransposition of L1 in neurons triggered by environmental and/or genetic risk factors may contribute to the susceptibility and pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

Abnormal brain connectivity may have a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. {OBJECTIVE}: To examine the structure of the rich club in schizophrenia and its role in global functional brain dynamics. {DESIGN}: Structural diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were performed in patients with schizophrenia and matched healthy controls. {SETTING}: Department of Psychiatry, Rudolf Magnus Institute of Neuroscience, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands. {PARTICIPANTS}: Forty-eight patients and 45 healthy controls participated in the study. An independent replication data set of 41 patients and 51 healthy controls was included to replicate and validate significant findings. {MAIN} {OUTCOME}(S) {AND} {MEASURES}: Measures of rich club organization, connectivity density of rich club connections and connections linking peripheral regions to brain hubs, measures of global brain network efficiency, and measures of coupling between brain structure and functional dynamics. {RESULTS}: Rich club organization between high-degree hub nodes was significantly affected in patients, together with a reduced density of rich club connections predominantly comprising the white matter pathways that link the midline frontal, parietal, and insular hub regions. This reduction in rich club density was found to be associated with lower levels of global communication capacity, a relationship that was absent for other white matter pathways. In addition, patients had an increase in the strength of structural connectivity-functional connectivity coupling. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings provide novel biological evidence that schizophrenia is characterized by a selective disruption of brain connectivity among central hub regions of the brain, potentially leading to reduced communication capacity and altered functional brain dynamics.},

	abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from {RNA}-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between {RNA} samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the {edgeR} package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods ({GLMs}) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of {GLMs} to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from {DNA}-Seq applications, including {ChIP}-Seq for epigenetic marks and {DNA} methylation analyses.},

	abstract = {Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}) studies, but any pair of {GWAS} datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including {\textbackslash}textgreater100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with {eQTLs} and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported {eQTL}-lipid pairs ({SYPL}2, {IFT}172, {TBKBP}1) for which our analysis suggests that the {eQTL} pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with {SORT}1, {GCKR}, and {KPNB}1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single {SNP} summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple {GWAS} datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways.},

These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or {FPKMs} from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts.

This may be due to variations in study design, setting and diagnostic criteria. In particular, several studies conducted in developing countries have found no difference or a reversed effect whereby females have an earlier onset. The aim of the study was to investigate gender differences in age of onset, and the impact of study design and setting on estimates thereof. {METHOD}: Study methods were a systematic literature search, meta-analysis and meta-regression. {RESULTS}: A total of 46 studies with 29,218 males and 19,402 females fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were entered into a meta-analysis. A random-effects model gave a pooled estimate of the gender difference of 1.07 years (95\% confidence interval 0.21-1.93) for age at first admission of schizophrenia, with males having earlier onset. The gender difference in age at onset was not significantly different between developed and developing countries. Studies using diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ({DSM}) criteria showed a significantly greater gender difference in age at onset than studies using International Classification Of Diseases ({ICD}) criteria, the latter showing no difference. {CONCLUSIONS}: The gender difference in age of onset in schizophrenia is smaller than previously thought, and appears absent in studies using {ICD}.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Spotted arrays are often printed with probes in duplicate or triplicate, but current methods for assessing differential expression are not able to make full use of the resulting information. The usual practice is to average the duplicate or triplicate results for each probe before assessing differential expression. This results in the loss of valuable information about genewise variability. {RESULTS}: A method is proposed for extracting more information from within-array replicate spots in microarray experiments by estimating the strength of the correlation between them. The method involves fitting separate linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in {RNA}. Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows that the common correlation method results in substantially better discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances when the sample size is small. {AVAILABILITY}: The methodology is implemented in the limma software package for R, available from the {CRAN} repository http://www.r-project.org},

Accumulating evidence implicates cellular and molecular alterations within cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuitry in the development and persistence of this disease. The striatum is a heterogeneous structure that sits at the interface of this circuit, receiving input from a variety of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, ventral tegmental area) to guide behavioral output, including motor planning, decision-making, motivation and reward. However, the vast interconnectivity of this circuit has made it difficult to isolate how individual projections and cellular subtypes within this circuit modulate each of the facets of addiction. Here, we review the use of new technologies, including optogenetics and {DREADDs} (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs), in unraveling the role of the striatum in addiction. In particular, we focus on the role of striatal cell populations (i.e., direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons) and striatal dopaminergic and glutamatergic afferents in addiction-related plasticity and behaviors.

Two isoforms of the D2 receptor are generated by differential splicing of the same gene and are referred to as short (D2S) and long (D2L) dopamine receptors. Here we have used wild-type mice, dopamine D2 receptor knockout mice (D2 {KO} mice; lacking both D2S and D2L receptors) and D2L receptor-selective knockout mice (D2L {KO} mice) to evaluate the involvement of each isoform in the regulation of the phosphorylation of {TH} and {DARPP}-32. Incubation of striatal slices from wild-type mice with quinpirole, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, decreased the state of phosphorylation of {TH} at Ser-40 and its enzymatic activity. Both effects were abolished in D2 {KO} mice but were still present in D2L {KO} mice. In wild-type mice, quinpirole inhibits the increase in {DARPP}-32 phosphorylation at Thr-34 induced by {SKF}81297, a dopamine D1 receptor agonist. This effect is absent in D2 {KO} as well as D2L {KO} mice. The inability of quinpirole to regulate {DARPP}-32 phosphorylation in D2L {KO} mice cannot be attributed to decreased coupling of D2S receptors to G proteins, because quinpirole produces a similar stimulation of [(35)S]{GTPgammaS} binding in wild-type and D2L {KO} mice. These results demonstrate that D2S and D2L receptors participate in presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic transmission, respectively.},

They differ by an in-frame insert of 29 amino acids specific to D2L within the putative third intracytoplasmic loop of the receptor. We have previously demonstrated (Montmayeur, J.-P., Guiramand, J., and Borelli, E. (1993) Mol. Endocrinol. 7, 161-170) that D2S and D2L, although presenting very similar pharmacological profiles, couple differently to the alpha-subunit of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins). In particular, D2L, but not D2S, requires the presence of the alpha-subunit of the inhibitory G-protein (G alpha i2) to elicit greater inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. The insert present in D2L must therefore confer the specificity of interaction with G alpha i2. Thus, we introduced substitution mutations within the D2L insert. These mutant receptors were expressed in {JEG}3 cells, a G alpha i2-deficient cell line, scoring for those presenting an increased inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by dopamine. Our analysis identified two mutants, S259/262A and D249V, with these properties. These results clearly show that the insert present in D2L plays a critical role in the selectivity for the G-proteins interacting with the receptor.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: During the past 5 years, high-throughput technologies have been successfully used by epidemiology studies, but almost all have focused on sequence variation through genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}). Today, the study of other genomic events is becoming more common in large-scale epidemiological studies. Many of these, unlike the single-nucleotide polymorphism studied in {GWAS}, are continuous measures. In this context, the exercise of searching for regions of interest for disease is akin to the problems described in the statistical 'bump hunting' literature. {METHODS}: New statistical challenges arise when the measurements are continuous rather than categorical, when they are measured with uncertainty, and when both biological signal, and measurement errors are characterized by spatial correlation along the genome. Perhaps the most challenging complication is that continuous genomic data from large studies are measured throughout long periods, making them susceptible to 'batch effects'. An example that combines all three characteristics is genome-wide {DNA} methylation measurements. Here, we present a data analysis pipeline that effectively models measurement error, removes batch effects, detects regions of interest and attaches statistical uncertainty to identified regions. {RESULTS}: We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by detecting genomic regions of {DNA} methylation associated with a continuous trait in a well-characterized population of newborns. Additionally, we show that addressing unexplained heterogeneity like batch effects reduces the number of false-positive regions. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our framework offers a comprehensive yet flexible approach for identifying genomic regions of biological interest in large epidemiological studies using quantitative high-throughput methods.},

	abstract = {Aging is a major risk factor for many human diseases, and in vitro generation of human neurons is an attractive approach for modeling aging-related brain disorders. However, modeling aging in differentiated human neurons has proved challenging. We generated neurons from human donors across a broad range of ages, either by {iPSC}-based reprogramming and differentiation or by direct conversion into induced neurons ({iNs}). While {iPSCs} and derived neurons did not retain aging-associated gene signatures, {iNs} displayed age-specific transcriptional profiles and revealed age-associated decreases in the nuclear transport receptor {RanBP}17. We detected an age-dependent loss of nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization ({NCC}) in donor fibroblasts and corresponding {iNs} and found that reduced {RanBP}17 impaired {NCC} in young cells, while {iPSC} rejuvenation restored {NCC} in aged cells. These results show that {iNs} retain important aging-related signatures, thus allowing modeling of the aging process in vitro, and they identify impaired {NCC} as an important factor in human aging.

	abstract = {Brain function and cognitive performance differ between men and women in some measures. The phenotypic variation may be partially due to sex differences in epigenomes and transcriptomes in specific brain regions [e.g. the prefrontal cortex ({PFC})]. Genome-wide {DNA} methylation and gene expression were examined in postmortem {PFC} of 32 males and 14 females (all were Caucasians) using Illumina's 450K Methylation and {HT}-12 v4 Gene Expression {BeadChips}, respectively. Multiple linear regression, Pearson correlation and {DAVID} functional annotation analyses were applied to investigate sex-biased {DNA} methylation and gene expression, {DNA} methylation-gene expression correlation and gene ontology ({GO}) annotations overrepresented by differentially methylated and expressed genes. A total of 22 124 {CpGs} showed differential methylation between males and females (2.6 × 10(-38) ≤ Pnominal ≤ 0.05), and the P-values of 8357 {CpGs} withstood multiple-testing correction (q {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). A total of 1489 genes showed differential expression between males and females (4.1 × 10(-36) ≤ Pnominal ≤ 0.05), and the P-values of 35 genes survived multiple-testing correction (q {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). A significant correlation (Pcorrelation {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) was observed between methylation levels of 585 differentially methylated {CpGs} (Pnominal ≤ 0.05) and expression levels of 188 differentially expressed host genes (Pnominal {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). The {GO} terms enriched by these 188 genes (134 on autosomes and 54 on sex chromosomes) were assigned to 24 clusters, and 33 genes involved in the top cluster (enrichment score: 4.7) mainly participate in ribosome structure and function, {RNA} binding and protein translation. This study demonstrated sex-specific methylomic and transcriptomic profiles in the human {PFC}.

The molecular basis of these differences remains unclear. Progress in this field has been hampered by the lack of genome-wide information on sex differences in gene expression and in particular splicing in the human brain. Here we address this issue by using post-mortem adult human brain and spinal cord samples originating from 137 neuropathologically confirmed control individuals to study whole-genome gene expression and splicing in 12 {CNS} regions. We show that sex differences in gene expression and splicing are widespread in adult human brain, being detectable in all major brain regions and involving 2.5\% of all expressed genes. We give examples of genes where sex-biased expression is both disease-relevant and likely to have functional consequences, and provide evidence suggesting that sex biases in expression may reflect sex-biased gene regulatory structures.},

Patients fulfilled {DSM}-{IV} criteria for schizophrenia, had no history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence, and were neuroleptic free for a minimum of 21 days. Amphetamine-induced dopamine release was assessed by the reduction in dopamine D2 receptor availability induced by an acute amphetamine challenge (0.3 mg/kg, intravenous bolus). Reduction in D2 receptor availability was measured with single photon emission computed tomography and the D2 receptor radiotracer [123I]{IBZM}. {RESULTS}: No differences were observed between patients with schizophrenia and the comparison group in D2 receptor availability at baseline. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited a significantly larger reduction in D2 receptor availability following acute amphetamine challenge than the comparison group. In this study, the effect size was smaller than in the first study. Excess dopamine release following amphetamine was associated with transient emergence or worsening of positive symptoms. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this new cohort of subjects the authors replicated their initial observation of a dysregulation of striatal dopamine release in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {A major line of evidence that supports the hypothesis of dopamine overactivity in schizophrenia is the psychomimetic potential of agents such as amphetamine that stimulate dopamine outflow. A novel brain imaging method provides an indirect measure of in vivo synaptic dopamine concentration by quantifying the change in dopamine receptor radiotracer binding produced by agents that alter dopamine release but do not themselves bind to dopamine receptors. The purpose of this investigation is (i) to determine the sensitivity (i.e., amount of dopamine reflected in radiotracer binding changes) of this method by examining the relationship between amphetamine-induced changes in simultaneously derived striatal extracellular dopamine levels with in vivo microdialysis and striatal binding levels with the dopamine D2/D3 positron-emission tomography radioligand [11C]raclopride in nonhuman primates, and (ii) to test the hypothesis of elevated amphetamine-induced synaptic dopamine levels in schizophrenia. In the nonhuman primate study (n = 4), doubling the amphetamine dose produced a doubling in [11C]raclopride specific binding reductions. In addition, the ratio of percent mean dopamine increase to percent mean striatal binding reduction for amphetamine (0.2 mg/kg) was 44:1, demonstrating that relatively small binding changes reflect large changes in dopamine outflow. In the clinical study, patients with schizophrenia (n = 11) compared with healthy volunteers (n = 12) had significantly greater amphetamine-related reductions in [11C]raclopride specific binding (mean +/- {SEM}): -22.3\% (+/-2.7) vs. -15.5\% (+/-1.8),P = 0.04, respectively. Inferences from the preclinical study suggest that the patients' elevation in synaptic dopamine concentrations was substantially greater than controls.

Demographic, clinical, and methodological variables were extracted from each study or obtained from the authors and tested as covariates.

Heterogeneity was addressed with the Q statistic and I(2) index. {RESULTS}: Patients and controls were well matched in sociodemographic variables (P {\textbackslash}textgreater .05). Quantitative evaluation of publication bias was nonsignificant (P = .276). Heterogeneity across study was modest in magnitude and statistically nonsignificant (Q = 19.19; P = .078; I (2) = 39.17).

The time-radioactivity curve from occipital cortex (located within Brodman area 17 and 18) was used as input function to calculate L-{DOPA} influx rate, Ki images, that were matched to a common brain atlas. A significant overall increase of the Ki values was found in the schizophrenic group as compared with healthy controls. {RESULTS}: In particular, significantly higher Ki were found in the schizophrenic patients compared to the controls in the caudate nucleus, putamen and in parts of medial prefrontal cortex (Brod 24). The Ki value reflect an increased utilization of L-{DOPA}, presumably due to increased activity of the amino acid decarboxylate enzyme. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results indicate that the synthesis of dopamine is elevated within the striatum and parts of medial prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia.},

During a search for abnormalities of catecholaminergic neurotransmission in patients with complex partial seizures of the mesial temporal lobe, we discovered an increase of the rate of metabolism of an exogenous dopa tracer (6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa) in the neostriatum of a subgroup of patients with a history of psychosis. When specifically assayed for this abnormality, patients with schizophrenia revealed the same significant increase of the rate of metabolism in the striatum. The finding is consistent with the theory that a state of psychosis arises when episodic dopamine excess is superimposed on a trait of basic dopamine deficiency in the striatum. The finding is explained by the hypothesis that cortical insufficiency, a proposed pathogenetic mechanism of both disorders, causes an up-regulation of the enzymes responsible for dopa turnover in the neostriatum as well as the receptors mediating dopaminergic neurotransmission.},

	abstract = {Perhaps the most surprising revelation that has emerged from recent pathologic studies of schizophrenia is the marked cortical regional heterogeneity of the disease. Areal specific alterations of many parameters have been reported (e.g., neuronal density, density of gamma-aminobutyric acid [{GABA}]-immunoreactive cells, and concentration of synapse-associated proteins and messenger ribonucleic acid [{mRNA}]s). In the past 5 years, as a flood of seemingly contradictory findings have been published, divergent findings often have been regarded as further evidence of the irreplicability and futility of postmortem studies. Although some discrepancies in findings may be due to methodological differences or to the study of different cohorts of patients, a growing number of laboratories are examining the same parameter(s) in multiple cortical areas in a single brain cohort and finding regionally specific abnormalities. These findings provide compelling evidence that cortical pathology in schizophrenia is nonuniform and complex. A major challenge in contemporary schizophrenia research is to make sense of the patterning of whole brain pathology in schizophrenia, as the mosaic of neuropathologic alterations may provide clues to the disease etiology.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recently, rapid improvements in technology and decrease in sequencing costs have made {RNA}-Seq a widely used technique to quantify gene expression levels. Various normalization approaches have been proposed, owing to the importance of normalization in the analysis of {RNA}-Seq data. A comparison of recently proposed normalization methods is required to generate suitable guidelines for the selection of the most appropriate approach for future experiments. {RESULTS}: In this paper, we compared eight non-abundance ({RC}, {UQ}, Med, {TMM}, {DESeq}, Q, {RPKM}, and {ERPKM}) and two abundance estimation normalization methods ({RSEM} and Sailfish). The experiments were based on real Illumina high-throughput {RNA}-Seq of 35- and 76-nucleotide sequences produced in the {MAQC} project and simulation reads. Reads were mapped with human genome obtained from {UCSC} Genome Browser Database. For precise evaluation, we investigated Spearman correlation between the normalization results from {RNA}-Seq and {MAQC} {qRT}-{PCR} values for 996 genes. Based on this work, we showed that out of the eight non-abundance estimation normalization methods, {RC}, {UQ}, Med, {TMM}, {DESeq}, and Q gave similar normalization results for all data sets. For {RNA}-Seq of a 35-nucleotide sequence, {RPKM} showed the highest correlation results, but for {RNA}-Seq of a 76-nucleotide sequence, least correlation was observed than the other methods. {ERPKM} did not improve results than {RPKM}. Between two abundance estimation normalization methods, for {RNA}-Seq of a 35-nucleotide sequence, higher correlation was obtained with Sailfish than that with {RSEM}, which was better than without using abundance estimation methods. However, for {RNA}-Seq of a 76-nucleotide sequence, the results achieved by {RSEM} were similar to without applying abundance estimation methods, and were much better than with Sailfish. Furthermore, we found that adding a poly-A tail increased alignment numbers, but did not improve normalization results. {CONCLUSION}: Spearman correlation analysis revealed that {RC}, {UQ}, Med, {TMM}, {DESeq}, and Q did not noticeably improve gene expression normalization, regardless of read length. Other normalization methods were more efficient when alignment accuracy was low; Sailfish with {RPKM} gave the best normalization results. When alignment accuracy was high, {RC} was sufficient for gene expression calculation. And we suggest ignoring poly-A tail during differential gene expression analysis.},

	abstract = {Historically, the human brain has been conceptually segregated from the periphery and further dichotomized into gray matter ({GM}) and white matter ({WM}) based on the whitish appearance of the exceptionally high lipid content of the myelin sheaths encasing neuronal axons. These simplistic dichotomies were unfortunately extended to conceptually segregate neurons from glia, cognition from behavior, and have been codified in the separation of clinical and scientific fields into medicine, psychiatry, neurology, pathology, etc. The discrete classifications have helped obscure the importance of continual dynamic communication between all brain cell types (neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and precursor ({NG}2) cells) as well as between brain and periphery through multiple signaling systems. The signaling systems range from neurotransmitters to insulin, angiotensin, and multiple kinases such a glycogen synthase kinase 3 ({GSK}-3) that together help integrate metabolism, inflammation, and myelination processes and orchestrate the development, plasticity, maintenance, and repair that continually optimize function of neural networks. A more comprehensive, evolution-based, systems biology approach that integrates brain, body, and environmental interactions may ultimately prove more fruitful in elucidating the complexities of human brain function. The historic focus on neurons/{GM} is rebalanced herein by highlighting the importance of a systems-level understanding of the interdependent age-related shifts in both central and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms that can lead to remarkably prevalent and devastating neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein we highlight the role of glia, especially the most recently evolved oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce, in achieving and maintaining optimal brain function. The human brain undergoes exceptionally protracted and pervasive myelination (even throughout its {GM}) and can thus achieve and maintain the rapid conduction and synchronous timing of neural networks on which optimal function depends. The continuum of increasing myelin vulnerability resulting from the human brain's protracted myelination underlies underappreciated communalities between different disease phenotypes ranging from developmental ones such as schizophrenia ({SZ}) and bipolar disorder ({BD}) to degenerative ones such as Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). These shared vulnerabilities also expose significant yet underexplored opportunities for novel treatment and prevention approaches that have the potential to considerably reduce the tremendous burden of neuropsychiatric disease. {\textbackslash}copyright 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, inferring population structure in large modern data sets imposes severe computational challenges. Here, we develop efficient algorithms for approximate inference of the model underlying the {STRUCTURE} program using a variational Bayesian framework. Variational methods pose the problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the number of populations represented in a data set and a new hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data and illustrate using genotype data from the {CEPH}-Human Genome Diversity Panel. The variational algorithms are almost two orders of magnitude faster than {STRUCTURE} and achieve accuracies comparable to those of {ADMIXTURE}. Furthermore, our results show that the heuristic scores for choosing model complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number of populations represented in the data, with minimal bias toward detecting structure when it is very weak.

For modern datasets, {eQTL} analysis is a computationally intensive task as it involves testing for association of billions of transcript-{SNP} (single-nucleotide polymorphism) pair. The heavy computational burden makes {eQTL} analysis less popular and sometimes forces analysts to restrict their attention to just a small subset of transcript-{SNP} pairs. As more transcripts and {SNPs} get interrogated over a growing number of samples, the demand for faster tools for {eQTL} analysis grows stronger. {RESULTS}: We have developed a new software for computationally efficient {eQTL} analysis called Matrix {eQTL}. In tests on large datasets, it was 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than existing popular tools for {QTL}/{eQTL} analysis, while finding the same {eQTLs}. The fast performance is achieved by special preprocessing and expressing the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm in terms of large matrix operations. Matrix {eQTL} supports additive linear and {ANOVA} models with covariates, including models with correlated and heteroskedastic errors. The issue of multiple testing is addressed by calculating false discovery rate; this can be done separately for cis- and trans-{eQTLs}.},

We investigated the influence of gender and oestrogen status on: (1) age at onset, (2) presenting symptom, (3) severity and progression of motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale {III} ({UPDRS}-{III}) scores) and (4) amount and progression of nigrostriatal degeneration ([123I]{FP}-{CIT} single photon emission computed tomography measurements). {RESULTS}: Age at onset was 2.1 years later in women (53.4 years) than in men (51.3 years). In women, age at onset correlated positively with parity, age at menopause and fertile life span. Women more often presented with tremor (67\%) than men (48\%). Overall, patients presenting with tremor had a 3.6 year higher age at onset and a 38\% slower {UPDRS}-{III} deterioration. Mean {UPDRS}-{III} scores at disease onset were equal for both genders, as was the rate of deterioration. Women had a 16\% higher striatal [123I]{FP}-{CIT} binding than men at symptom onset and throughout the course of {PD}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results suggest that, in women, the development of symptomatic {PD} may be delayed by higher physiological striatal dopamine levels, possibly due to the activity of oestrogens. This could explain the epidemiological observations of a lower incidence and higher age at onset in women. Women also presented more often with tremor which, in turn, is associated with milder motor deterioration and striatal degeneration. Taken together, these findings suggest a more benign phenotype in women with {PD}.},

	abstract = {Deficits in the expression of oligodendrocyte (Ol) and myelin genes have been described in numerous brain regions in schizophrenia ({SZ}) in association with abnormalities of cell cycle markers. We have previously reported a {SZ}-associated decrease in the expression of genes expressed after, but not prior to, the terminal differentiation of Ols in the posterior limb of the internal capsule ({ICp}). This pattern of deficits could reflect a failure of Ol precursors to exit the cell cycle and differentiate to meet the demands imposed by the high rate of apoptosis among myelinating Ols. Here we explore this hypothesis using quantitative real time {PCR} to examine the {mRNA} expression of additional genes in the {ICp} of the previously examined sample of 14 subjects with {SZ} and 15 normal controls ({NCs}). The genes examined in the present study were chosen because they are associated with particular phases of the cell cycle ({CCND}1, {CCND}2, p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1), and p57(Kip2)), with {DNA} replication and repair ({PCNA}), apoptosis ({CASP}3), or the Notch signaling pathway ({JAG}1, {HES}1, {HES}5, {andDTX}1). The Notch pathway influences whether Ol precursors continue to proliferate or exit the cell cycle. We also determined the densities of Ols in the {ICp}. Genes associated with maintenance of the cell cycle tended to exhibit increased expression levels in {SZ} relative to {NCs} and to be negatively correlated with the expression levels of the previously assessed mature Ol genes. In contrast, genes associated with cell cycle arrest tended to show the opposite pattern (decreased expression in {SZ} and positive correlations with mature Ol genes). {CASP}3 and {PCNA} expression levels were significantly decreased in {SZ} and positively correlated with mature Ol genes, suggesting that myelinating Ols may turnover more rapidly in normal controls than in subjects with {SZ}. {JAG}1 expression was significantly increased in {SZ} and exhibited positive correlations with mediators of the canonical Notch pathway but negative correlations with mature Ol genes. Ol densities were significantly decreased in {SZ}. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Ol and myelin deficits in {SZ} involve a failure of Ol precursors to appropriately exit the cell cycle in order to differentiate and mature into myelinating Ols.

	abstract = {The functional and molecular similarities and distinctions between human and murine astrocytes are poorly understood. Here, we report the development of an immunopanning method to acutely purify astrocytes from fetal, juvenile, and adult human brains and to maintain these cells in serum-free cultures. We found that human astrocytes have abilities similar to those of murine astrocytes in promoting neuronal survival, inducing functional synapse formation, and engulfing synaptosomes. In contrast to existing observations in mice, we found that mature human astrocytes respond robustly to glutamate. Next, we performed {RNA} sequencing of healthy human astrocytes along with astrocytes from epileptic and tumor foci and compared these to human neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells (available at http://www.brainrnaseq.org). With these profiles, we identified novel human-specific astrocyte genes and discovered a transcriptome-wide transformation between astrocyte precursor cells and mature post-mitotic astrocytes. These data represent some of the first cell-type-specific molecular profiles of the healthy and diseased human brain. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The hippocampus provided the gateway into much of what we have learned about stress and brain structural and functional plasticity, and this initial focus has expanded to other interconnected brain regions, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Starting with the discovery of adrenal steroid, and later, estrogen receptors in the hippocampal formation, and subsequent discovery of dendritic and spine synapse remodeling and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, mechanistic studies have revealed both genomic and rapid non-genomic actions of circulating steroid hormones in the brain. Many of these actions occur epigenetically and result in ever-changing patterns of gene expression, in which there are important sex differences that need further exploration. Moreover, glucocorticoid and estrogen actions occur synergistically with an increasing number of cellular mediators that help determine the qualitative nature of the response. The hippocampus has also been a gateway to understanding lasting epigenetic effects of early-life experiences. These findings in animal models have resulted in translation to the human brain and have helped change thinking about the nature of brain malfunction in psychiatric disorders and during aging, as well as the mechanisms of the effects of early-life adversity on the brain and the body.},

As a neurogenic niche, the hippocampus supports pronounced L1 activity. However, the basal parameters and biological impact of L1-driven mosaicism remain unclear. Here, we performed single-cell retrotransposon capture sequencing ({RC}-seq) on individual human hippocampal neurons and glia, as well as cortical neurons. An estimated 13.7 somatic L1 insertions occurred per hippocampal neuron and carried the sequence hallmarks of target-primed reverse transcription. Notably, hippocampal neuron L1 insertions were specifically enriched in transcribed neuronal stem cell enhancers and hippocampus genes, increasing their probability of functional relevance. In addition, bias against intronic L1 insertions sense oriented relative to their host gene was observed, perhaps indicating moderate selection against this configuration in vivo. These experiments demonstrate pervasive L1 mosaicism at genomic loci expressed in hippocampal neurons. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {PLINK} 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, {GWAS} and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by {PLINK} 1's primary data format. {FINDINGS}: To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for {PLINK}. The first major release from this codebase, {PLINK} 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, [Formula: see text]-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in {RAM}. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release ({PLINK} 2.0). {CONCLUSIONS}: The second-generation versions of {PLINK} will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.},

Schizophrenia's strongest genetic association at a population level involves variation in the major histocompatibility complex ({MHC}) locus, but the genes and molecular mechanisms accounting for this have been challenging to identify. Here we show that this association arises in part from many structurally diverse alleles of the complement component 4 (C4) genes. We found that these alleles generated widely varying levels of C4A and C4B expression in the brain, with each common C4 allele associating with schizophrenia in proportion to its tendency to generate greater expression of C4A. Human C4 protein localized to neuronal synapses, dendrites, axons, and cell bodies. In mice, C4 mediated synapse elimination during postnatal development. These results implicate excessive complement activity in the development of schizophrenia and may help explain the reduced numbers of synapses in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Abnormal brain connectivity or network dysfunction has been suggested as a paradigm to understand several psychiatric disorders. We here review the use of novel meta-analytic approaches in neuroscience that go beyond a summary description of existing results by applying network analysis methods to previously published studies and/or publicly accessible databases. We define this strategy of combining connectivity with other brain characteristics as 'meta-connectomics'. For example, we show how network analysis of task-based neuroimaging studies has been used to infer functional co-activation from primary data on regional activations. This approach has been able to relate cognition to functional network topology, demonstrating that the brain is composed of cognitively specialized functional subnetworks or modules, linked by a rich club of cognitively generalized regions that mediate many inter-modular connections. Another major application of meta-connectomics has been efforts to link meta-analytic maps of disorder-related abnormalities or {MRI} 'lesions' to the complex topology of the normative connectome. This work has highlighted the general importance of network hubs as hotspots for concentration of cortical grey-matter deficits in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and other disorders. Finally, we show how by incorporating cellular and transcriptional data on individual nodes with network models of the connectome, studies have begun to elucidate the microscopic mechanisms underpinning the macroscopic organization of whole-brain networks. We argue that meta-connectomics is an exciting field, providing robust and integrative insights into brain organization that will likely play an important future role in consolidating network models of psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}) are a complex group of neurodevelopmental disorders encompassing impairments in communication, social interactions and restricted stereotypical behaviors. Although a link between altered immune responses and {ASD} was first recognized nearly 40 years ago, only recently has new evidence started to shed light on the complex multifaceted relationship between immune dysfunction and behavior in {ASD}. Neurobiological research in {ASD} has highlighted pathways involved in neural development, synapse plasticity, structural brain abnormalities, cognition and behavior. At the same time, several lines of evidence point to altered immune dysfunction in {ASD} that directly impacts some or all these neurological processes. Extensive alterations in immune function have now been described in both children and adults with {ASD}, including ongoing inflammation in brain specimens, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in the {CSF} and blood, increased presence of brain-specific auto-antibodies and altered immune cell function. Furthermore, these dysfunctional immune responses are associated with increased impairments in behaviors characteristic of core features of {ASD}, in particular, deficits in social interactions and communication. This accumulating evidence suggests that immune processes play a key role in the pathophysiology of {ASD}. This review will discuss the current state of our knowledge of immune dysfunction in {ASD}, how these findings may impact on underlying neuro-immune mechanisms and implicate potential areas where the manipulation of the immune response could have an impact on behavior and immunity in {ASD}.

	abstract = {By aggregating data for complex traits in a biologically meaningful way, gene and gene-set analysis constitute a valuable addition to single-marker analysis. However, although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist, they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address these issues we have developed {MAGMA}, a novel tool for gene and gene-set analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model, to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn's Disease data are used to evaluate the performance of {MAGMA} and to compare it to a number of other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that {MAGMA} has significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set analysis, identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn's Disease while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the {MAGMA} analysis of the Crohn's Disease data was found to be considerably faster as well.},

	abstract = {Lateral gene transfer ({LGT})–which transfers {DNA} between two non-vertically related individuals belonging to the same or different species–is recognized as a major force in prokaryotic evolution, and evidence of its impact on eukaryotic evolution is ever increasing. {LGT} has attracted much public attention for its potential to transfer pathogenic elements and antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and to transfer pesticide resistance from genetically modified crops to other plants. In a wider perspective, there is a growing body of studies highlighting the role of {LGT} in enabling organisms to occupy new niches or adapt to environmental changes. The challenge {LGT} poses to the standard tree-based conception of evolution is also being debated. Studies of {LGT} have, however, been severely limited by a lack of computational tools. The best currently available {LGT} algorithms are parsimony-based phylogenetic methods, which require a pre-computed gene tree and cannot choose between sometimes wildly differing most parsimonious solutions. Moreover, in many studies, simple heuristics are applied that can only handle putative orthologs and completely disregard gene duplications ({GDs}). Consequently, proposed {LGT} among specific gene families, and the rate of {LGT} in general, remain debated. We present a Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo-based method that integrates {GD}, gene loss, {LGT}, and sequence evolution, and apply the method in a genome-wide analysis of two groups of bacteria: Mollicutes and Cyanobacteria. Our analyses show that although the {LGT} rate between distant species is high, the net combined rate of duplication and close-species {LGT} is on average higher. We also show that the common practice of disregarding reconcilability in gene tree inference overestimates the number of {LGT} and duplication events.},

	abstract = {Because the properties of horizontally-transferred genes will reflect the mutational proclivities of their donor genomes, they often show atypical compositional properties relative to native genes. Parametric methods use these discrepancies to identify bacterial genes recently acquired by horizontal transfer. However, compositional patterns of native genes vary stochastically, leaving no clear boundary between typical and atypical genes. As a result, while strongly atypical genes are readily identified as alien, genes of ambiguous character are poorly classified when a single threshold separates typical and atypical genes. This limitation affects all parametric methods that examine genes independently, and escaping it requires the use of additional genomic information. We propose that the performance of all parametric methods can be improved by using a multiple-threshold approach. First, strongly atypical alien genes and strongly typical native genes would be identified using conservative thresholds. Genes with ambiguous compositional features would then be classified by examining gene context, including the class (native or alien) of flanking genes. By including additional genomic information in a multiple-threshold framework, we observed a remarkable improvement in the performance of several popular, but algorithmically distinct, methods for alien gene detection. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2011.

A few association analyses between {GDNF} gene polymorphisms and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and drug abuse have also been published but little is known about any effects of these polymorphisms on mood characteristics such as anxiety and depression. Here we present an association study between eight (rs1981844, rs3812047, rs3096140, rs2973041, rs2910702, rs1549250, rs2973050 and rs11111) {GDNF} single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and anxiety and depression scores measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ({HADS}) on 708 Caucasian young adults with no psychiatric history. Results of the allele-wise single marker association analyses provided significant effects of two single nucleotide polymorphisms on anxiety scores following the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p = 0.00070 and p = 0.00138 for rs3812047 and rs3096140, respectively), while no such result was obtained on depression scores. Haplotype analysis confirmed the role of these {SNPs}; mean anxiety scores raised according to the number of risk alleles present in the haplotypes (p = 0.00029). A significant sex-gene interaction was also observed since the effect of the rs3812047 A allele as a risk factor of anxiety was more pronounced in males. In conclusion, this is the first demonstration of a significant association between the {GDNF} gene and mood characteristics demonstrated by the association of two {SNPs} of the {GDNF} gene (rs3812047 and rs3096140) and individual variability of anxiety using self-report data from a non-clinical sample.},

Soon after these breakthroughs, an exponential rate of genome sequencing was established, with a doubling time of approximately 20 months for bacteria and approximately 34 months for archaea. Comparative analysis of the hundreds of sequenced bacterial and dozens of archaeal genomes leads to several generalizations on the principles of genome organization and evolution. A crucial finding that enables functional characterization of the sequenced genomes and evolutionary reconstruction is that the majority of archaeal and bacterial genes have conserved orthologs in other, often, distant organisms. However, comparative genomics also shows that horizontal gene transfer ({HGT}) is a dominant force of prokaryotic evolution, along with the loss of genetic material resulting in genome contraction. A crucial component of the prokaryotic world is the mobilome, the enormous collection of viruses, plasmids and other selfish elements, which are in constant exchange with more stable chromosomes and serve as {HGT} vehicles. Thus, the prokaryotic genome space is a tightly connected, although compartmentalized, network, a novel notion that undermines the 'Tree of Life' model of evolution and requires a new conceptual framework and tools for the study of prokaryotic evolution.},

We identify aspects of the single-cell sequencing approach, bioinformatic analysis, and validation methods that led to thousands of artifacts being interpreted as somatic mutation events. Our reanalysis supports a mutation frequency of approximately 0.2 events per cell, which is about fifty-fold lower than reported, confirming that L1 elements mobilize in some human neurons but indicating that L1 mosaicism is not ubiquitous.

The results of using our algorithm to measure the functional similarities of genes in pathways retrieved from the saccharomyces genome database ({SGD}), and the outcomes of clustering these genes based on the similarity values obtained by our algorithm are shown to be consistent with human perspectives.

The mean lifetime prevalence of the disorder is just below 1\%, but large regional differences in prevalence rates are evident owing to disparities in urbanicity and patterns of immigration. Although gross brain pathology is not a characteristic of schizophrenia, the disorder involves subtle pathological changes in specific neural cell populations and in cell-cell communication. Schizophrenia, as a cognitive and behavioural disorder, is ultimately about how the brain processes information. Indeed, neuroimaging studies have shown that information processing is functionally abnormal in patients with first-episode and chronic schizophrenia. Although pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia can relieve psychotic symptoms, such drugs generally do not lead to substantial improvements in social, cognitive and occupational functioning. Psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, cognitive remediation and supported education and employment have added treatment value, but are inconsistently applied. Given that schizophrenia starts many years before a diagnosis is typically made, the identification of individuals at risk and those in the early phases of the disorder, and the exploration of preventive approaches are crucial.},

Regulatory trait concordance analysis ranked genes within schizophrenia genome-wide significant loci for a potential functional role, based on colocalization of a risk {SNP}, {eQTL}, and regulatory element sequence. We identified potential physical interactions of noncontiguous proximal and distal regulatory elements. This was verified in prefrontal cortex and -induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons for the L-type calcium channel ({CACNA}1C) risk locus.

These repertoires can be as small as approximately 200 genes in intracellular organisms or as large as approximately 9,000 genes in large, free-living bacteria. In this article we ask what is the impact of {HGT} from phylogenetically distant sources, relative to the size of the gene repertoire. Using different approaches for {HGT} detection and focusing on both cumulative and recent evolutionary histories, we find a surprising pattern of nonlinear enrichment of long-distance transfers in large genomes. Moreover, we find a strong positive correlation between the sizes of the donor and recipient genomes. Our results also show that distant horizontal transfers are biased toward those functional groups that are enriched in large genomes, showing that the trends in functional gene content and the impact of distant transfers are interdependent. These results highlight the intimate relationship between environmental and genomic complexity in microbes and suggest that an ecological, as opposed to phylogenetic, signal in gene content gains relative importance in large-genomed bacteria.},

	abstract = {Hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate ({NMDA}) receptor has been hypothesized to underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, based on the observation that non-competitive antagonists of the {NMDA} receptor, such as phencyclidine, induce schizophrenia-like symptoms. Mice lacking the {NR}2A subunit of the {NMDA} receptor complex are known to display abnormal behaviour, similar to schizophrenic symptoms. The expression of {NR}2A starts at puberty, a period corresponding to the clinical onset of schizophrenia. This evidence suggests that the {NR}2A ({GRIN}2A) gene may play a role in the development of schizophrenia and disease phenotypes. In this study, we performed a genetic analysis of this gene in schizophrenia. Analysis of the {GRIN}2A gene detected four single nucleotide polymorphisms, and a variable ({GT})(n) repeat in the promoter region of the gene. A case-control study (375 schizophrenics and 378 controls) demonstrated evidence of an association between the repeat polymorphism and the disease (P = 0.05, Mann-Whitney test), with longer alleles overly represented in patients. An in-vitro promoter assay revealed a length dependent inhibition of transcriptional activity by the ({GT})(n) repeat, which was consistent with a receptor binding assay in postmortem brains. Significantly, the score of symptom severity in chronic patients correlated with repeat size (P = 0.01, Spearman's Rank test). These results illustrate a genotype-phenotype correlation in schizophrenia and suggest that the longer ({GT})(n) stretch may act as a risk-conferring factor that worsens chronic outcome by reducing {GRIN}2A levels in the brain.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) have been widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate specification of familial relationships is crucial for family-based {GWAS}, as well as in population-based {GWAS} with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a {GWAS} should be routinely investigated using the {SNP} data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each {SNP} from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable. {RESULTS}: Here, we present a rapid algorithm for relationship inference using high-throughput genotype data typical of {GWAS} that allows the presence of unknown population substructure. The relationship of any pair of individuals can be precisely inferred by robust estimation of their kinship coefficient, independent of sample composition or population structure (sample invariance). We present simulation experiments to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient power to provide reliable inference on millions of unrelated pairs and thousands of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree relationships). Application of our robust algorithm to {HapMap} and {GWAS} datasets demonstrates that it performs properly even under extreme population stratification, while algorithms assuming a homogeneous population give systematically biased results. Our extremely efficient implementation performs relationship inference on millions of pairs of individuals in a matter of minutes, dozens of times faster than the most efficient existing algorithm known to us. {AVAILABILITY}: Our robust relationship inference algorithm is implemented in a freely available software package, {KING}, available for download at http://people.virginia.edu/∼wc9c/{KING}.},

Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate {FDR} traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach—we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate {pFDR} and {FDR}, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that {pFDR} is probably the quantity of interest over {FDR}. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the {pFDR} analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini–Hochberg {FDR} method.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene set enrichment ({GSE}) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible {GSE} methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. {RESULTS}: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis ({GSVA}), a {GSE} method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of {GSVA} in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how {GSVA} works analogously with data from both microarray and {RNA}-seq experiments. {CONCLUSIONS}: {GSVA} provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While {GSE} methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, {GSVA} constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, {GSVA} contributes to the current need of {GSE} methods for {RNA}-seq data. {GSVA} is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

A compromise is to use all available data, but to down-weight the observations from more variable samples. We describe a statistical approach that facilitates this by modelling heterogeneity at both the sample and observational levels as part of the differential expression analysis. At the sample level this is achieved by fitting a log-linear variance model that includes common sample-specific or group-specific parameters that are shared between genes. The estimated sample variance factors are then converted to weights and combined with observational level weights obtained from the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts-per-million using 'voom'. A comprehensive analysis involving both simulations and experimental {RNA}-sequencing data demonstrates that this strategy leads to a universally more powerful analysis and fewer false discoveries when compared to conventional approaches. This methodology has wide application and is implemented in the open-source 'limma' package. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2015.

	abstract = {Although schizophrenia ({SZ}) is defined by waking phenomena, abnormal sleep is a common feature. In particular, there is accumulating evidence of a sleep spindle deficit. Sleep spindles, a defining thalamocortical oscillation of non-rapid eye movement stage 2 sleep, correlate with {IQ} and are thought to promote long-term potentiation and enhance memory consolidation. We review evidence that reduced spindle activity in {SZ} is an endophenotype that impairs sleep-dependent memory consolidation, contributes to symptoms, and is a novel treatment biomarker. Studies showing that spindles can be pharmacologically enhanced in {SZ} and that increasing spindles improves memory in healthy individuals suggest that treating spindle deficits in patients with {SZ} may improve cognition. Spindle activity is highly heritable, and recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified {SZ} risk genes that may contribute to spindle deficits and illuminate their mechanisms. For example, the {SZ} risk gene {CACNA}1I encodes a calcium channel that is abundantly expressed in the thalamic spindle generator and plays a critical role in spindle activity based on a mouse knockout. Future genetic studies of animals and humans can delineate the role of this and other genes in spindles. Such cross-disciplinary research, by forging empirical links in causal chains from risk genes to proteins and cellular functions to endophenotypes, cognitive impairments, symptoms, and diagnosis, has the potential to advance the mechanistic understanding, treatment, and prevention of {SZ}. This review highlights the importance of deficient sleep-dependent memory consolidation among the cognitive deficits of {SZ} and implicates reduced sleep spindles as a potentially treatable mechanism.

	abstract = {Considerable progress towards an understanding of complex diseases has been made in recent years due to the development of high-throughput genotyping technologies. Using microarrays that contain millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}), Genome Wide Association Studies ({GWASs}) have identified {SNPs} that are associated with many complex diseases or traits. For example, as of February 2015, 2111 association studies have identified 15,396 {SNPs} for various diseases and traits, with the number of identified {SNP}-disease/trait associations increasing rapidly in recent years. However, it has been difficult for researchers to understand disease risk from {GWAS} results. This is because most {GWAS}-identified {SNPs} are located in non-coding regions of the genome. It is important to consider that the {GWAS}-identified {SNPs} serve only as representatives for all {SNPs} in the same haplotype block, and it is equally likely that other {SNPs} in high linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) with the array-identified {SNPs} are causal for the disease. Because it was hoped that disease-associated coding variants would be identified if the true casual {SNPs} were known, investigators have expanded their analyses using {LD} calculation and fine-mapping. However, such analyses also identified risk-associated {SNPs} located in non-coding regions. Thus, the {GWAS} field has been left with the conundrum as to how a single-nucleotide change in a non-coding region could confer increased risk for a specific disease. One possible answer to this puzzle is that the variant {SNPs} cause changes in gene expression levels rather than causing changes in protein function. This review provides a description of (1) advances in genomic and epigenomic approaches that incorporate functional annotation of regulatory elements to prioritize the disease risk-associated {SNPs} that are located in non-coding regions of the genome for follow-up studies, (2) various computational tools that aid in identifying gene expression changes caused by the non-coding disease-associated {SNPs}, and (3) experimental approaches to identify target genes of, and study the biological phenotypes conferred by, non-coding disease-associated {SNPs}.},

Their relative importance varies between lineages, yet both are complementary rather than independent, separable evolutionary forces. The replication process inevitably merges together their effects on the genome. We develop the concept of "open lineages" to characterize evolutionary lineages that over time accumulate more changes in their genomes by lateral transfer than by mutation. They contrast with "closed lineages," in which most of the changes are caused by mutation. Open and closed lineages are interspersed along the branches of any tree of prokaryotes. This patchy distribution conflicts with the basic assumptions of traditional phylogenetic approaches. As a result, a tree representation including both open and closed lineages is a misrepresentation. The evolution of all prokaryotic lineages cannot be studied under a single model unless new phylogenetic approaches that are more pluralistic about lineage evolution are designed.},

	abstract = {Darwin claimed that a unique inclusively hierarchical pattern of relationships between all organisms based on their similarities and differences [the Tree of Life ({TOL})] was a fact of nature, for which evolution, and in particular a branching process of descent with modification, was the explanation. However, there is no independent evidence that the natural order is an inclusive hierarchy, and incorporation of prokaryotes into the {TOL} is especially problematic. The only data sets from which we might construct a universal hierarchy including prokaryotes, the sequences of genes, often disagree and can seldom be proven to agree. Hierarchical structure can always be imposed on or extracted from such data sets by algorithms designed to do so, but at its base the universal {TOL} rests on an unproven assumption about pattern that, given what we know about process, is unlikely to be broadly true. This is not to say that similarities and differences between organisms are not to be accounted for by evolutionary mechanisms, but descent with modification is only one of these mechanisms, and a single tree-like pattern is not the necessary (or expected) result of their collective operation. Pattern pluralism (the recognition that different evolutionary models and representations of relationships will be appropriate, and true, for different taxa or at different scales or for different purposes) is an attractive alternative to the quixotic pursuit of a single true {TOL}.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia patients are behaviorally supersensitive to dopamine-like drugs such as amphetamine or methylphenidate, meaning that patients respond to such drugs with increased psychotic symptoms, as compared to control subjects. A basis of such supersensitivity may be an increased pre-synaptic release of dopamine or a post-synaptic elevation of D2 receptors or of D2High receptors in active stages of schizophrenia. While the pre-synaptic release of dopamine is normal in stable patients with schizophrenia, brain imaging studies find that D2 receptors are increased by an average of 5.8\% in antipsychotic-free schizophrenia patients. It is possible that the behavioral supersensitivity may stem from more D2High receptors in schizophrenia. Although the antipsychotic/dopamine D2 receptor can exist in vitro in a state of high affinity for dopamine (as D2High), or in a state of low affinity for dopamine (as D2Low), there is no clear evidence that D2High states can be selectively labeled or stably exist in vivo. Nevertheless, two studies revealed an 80\% increase in apparent D2High receptors in schizophrenia patients after reducing endogenous dopamine. The elevation in apparent D2High receptors in vivo in schizophrenia matches the elevation in D2High receptors in vitro in animal models of psychosis, including dopamine-supersensitive animals pretreated with amphetamine, marijuana, or phencyclidine, or animals with gene knockouts in various neurotransmitter pathways, including those for glutamate receptors. The elevation of D2High receptors in vitro and the increased apparent D2High receptors in vivo is consistent with behavioral dopamine supersensitivity in schizophrenia patients. {\textbackslash}copyright 2013 Elsevier B.V. and {ECNP}.

We report strong trans associations between variation in the {MHC} locus and {TCR} V gene usage. Fine-mapping of the association signals identifies specific amino acids from {MHC} genes that bias V gene usage, many of which contact or are spatially proximal to the {TCR} or peptide in the {TCR}-peptide-{MHC} complex. Hence, these {MHC} variants, several of which are linked to autoimmune diseases, can directly affect {TCR}-{MHC} interaction.

	abstract = {Ancestry informative markers ({AIMs}) are genetic loci showing alleles with large frequency differences between populations. {AIMs} can be used to estimate biogeographical ancestry at the level of the population, subgroup (e.g. cases and controls) and individual. Ancestry estimates at both the subgroup and individual level can be directly instructive regarding the genetics of the phenotypes that differ qualitatively or in frequency between populations. These estimates can provide a compelling foundation for the use of admixture mapping ({AM}) methods to identify the genes underlying these traits. We present details of a panel of 34 {AIMs} and demonstrate how such studies can proceed, by using skin pigmentation as a model phenotype. We have genotyped these markers in two population samples with primarily African ancestry, viz. African Americans from Washington D.C. and an African Caribbean sample from Britain, and in a sample of European Americans from Pennsylvania. In the two African population samples, we observed significant correlations between estimates of individual ancestry and skin pigmentation as measured by reflectometry (R(2)=0.21, P{\textbackslash}textless 0.0001 for the African-American sample and R(2)=0.16, P{\textbackslash}textless 0.0001 for the British African-Caribbean sample). These correlations confirm the validity of the ancestry estimates and also indicate the high level of population structure related to admixture, a level that characterizes these populations and that is detectable by using other tests to identify genetic structure. We have also applied two methods of admixture mapping to test for the effects of three candidate genes ({TYR}, {OCA}2, {MC}1R) on pigmentation.

Neurons carry out essential functions such as signal transmission and network integration in the central nervous system and are the main targets of neurodegenerative disease. In this Review, I address how the neuron's environment also contributes to neurodegeneration. Maintaining an optimal milieu for neuronal function rests with supportive cells termed glia and the blood-brain barrier. Accumulating evidence suggests that neurodegeneration occurs in part because the environment is affected during disease in a cascade of processes collectively termed neuroinflammation. These observations indicate that therapies targeting glial cells might provide benefit for those afflicted by neurodegenerative disorders.

Through their ability to conduct calcium across the cellular membrane at potentials close to the resting potential, T-type calcium channels are critically important for regulating neuronal excitability, both in the central and peripheral nervous system. T-type channels are also linked to an increasing number of neurological disorders such as the absence epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Although there is substantial literature dealing with regulation of native T-type channels, the underlying molecular mechanism has only recently been addressed. It is, therefore, critical to understand the cellular mechanisms that control T-type channel activity and expression, because this could provide important insight into designing novel therapeutic strategies targeting these channels.},

	abstract = {The question of a potential biological sexual signature in the human brain is a heavily disputed subject. In order to provide further insight into this issue, we used an evolutionary approach to identify genes with sex differences in brain expression level among primates. We reasoned that expression patterns important to uphold key male and female characteristics may be conserved during evolution. We selected cortex for our studies because this specific brain region is responsible for many higher behavioral functions. We compared gene expression profiles in the occipital cortex of male and female humans (Homo sapiens, a great ape) and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis, an old world monkey), two catarrhine species that show abundant morphological sexual dimorphism, as well as in common marmosets (Callithrix Jacchus, a new world monkey) which are relatively sexually monomorphic. We identified hundreds of genes with sex-biased expression patterns in humans and macaques, while fewer than ten were differentially expressed between the sexes in marmosets. In primates, a general rule is that many of the morphological and behavioral sexual dimorphisms seen in polygamous species, such as macaques, are typically less pronounced in monogamous species such as the marmosets. Our observations suggest that this correlation may also be reflected in the extent of sex-biased gene expression in the brain. We identified 85 genes with common sex-biased expression, in both human and macaque and 2 genes, X inactivation-specific transcript ({XIST}) and Heat shock factor binding protein 1 ({HSBP}1), that were consistently sex-biased in the female direction in human, macaque, and marmoset. These observations imply a conserved signature of sexual gene expression dimorphism in cortex of primates. Further, we found that the coding region of female-biased genes is more evolutionarily constrained compared to the coding region of both male-biased and non sex-biased brain expressed genes. We found genes with conserved sexual gene expression dimorphism in the occipital cortex of humans, cynomolgus macaques, and common marmosets. Genes within sexual expression profiles may underlie important functional differences between the sexes, with possible importance during primate evolution.},

Expression {QTL} results from eight published brain studies were compared to blood {eQTL} identified in from a meta-analysis involving 5,311 individuals. We accounted for differences in {SNP} platforms and study design by using {SNP} proxies in high linkage disequilibrium with reported {eQTL}. The degree of overlap between studies was calculated by ascertaining if an {eQTL} identified in one study was also identified in the other study. {RESULTS}: The percentage of {eQTL} overlapping for brain and blood expression after adjusting for differences in sample size ranged from 13 - 23\% (mean 19.2\%). Amongst pairs of brain studies {eQTL} overlap ranged from 0 - 35\%, with higher degrees of overlap found for studies using expression data collected from the same brain region. {CONCLUSION}: Our results suggest that whenever possible tissue specific to the pathophysiology of the disease being studied should be used for transcription analysis.},

A genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) showed a single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}), rs10761482 in ankyrin 3 ({ANK}3), a major neuron-enriched gene, was associated with schizophrenia although inconsistent results had been reported. Two meta analyses reported another {SNP} rs10994336 in {ANK}3 gene confers risk to bipolar disorder ({BD}). Due to evidence of genetic overlap between schizophrenia and {BD}, we investigated common findings by analyzing the association of {ANK}3 polymorphisms (rs10761482, rs10994336, and two missenses, rs3808942 and rs3808943) with schizophrenia, using the Han Chinese population. A total of 516 schizophrenia cases, 400 controls, and 81 trios of early onset schizophrenia were recruited for association studies. Furthermore, the published datasets were combined with our results to determine the effect of the loci on schizophrenia. Our association study showed the frequencies of C allele of rs10761482 and T allele of rs10994336 were higher in patients than in controls. Furthermore, allele condition analyses indicated the association signal observed at rs10761482 and rs10994336 was independent. A haplotype analysis revealed the rs10761482-rs3808942-rs3808943 haplotype was associated with schizophrenia. The frequency of the T-T-T haplotype was higher in patients than in controls. In the transmission disequilibrium test analysis, the C allele of rs10761482 and the rs10761482-rs3808942-rs3808943 haplotype were preferentially transmitted in the trios. Meta analysis incorporating previous and current studies also showed rs10761482 and rs10994336 were associated with schizophrenia.

	abstract = {Several methods have been proposed to estimate the variance in disease liability explained by large sets of genetic markers. However, current methods do not scale up well to large sample sizes. Linear mixed models require solving high-dimensional matrix equations, and methods that use polygenic scores are very computationally intensive. Here we propose a fast analytic method that uses polygenic scores, based on the formula for the non-centrality parameter of the association test of the score. We estimate model parameters from the results of multiple polygenic score tests based on markers with p values in different intervals. We estimate parameters by maximum likelihood and use profile likelihood to compute confidence intervals. We compare various options for constructing polygenic scores, based on nested or disjoint intervals of p values, weighted or unweighted effect sizes, and different numbers of intervals, in estimating the variance explained by a set of markers, the proportion of markers with effects, and the genetic covariance between a pair of traits. Our method provides nearly unbiased estimates and confidence intervals with good coverage, although estimation of the variance is less reliable when jointly estimated with the covariance. We find that disjoint p value intervals perform better than nested intervals, but the weighting did not affect our results. A particular advantage of our method is that it can be applied to summary statistics from single markers, and so can be quickly applied to large consortium datasets. Our method, named {AVENGEME} (Additive Variance Explained and Number of Genetic Effects Method of Estimation), is implemented in R software.

A genome-wide study is needed to characterize the genes that affect the clinical response and their adverse effects. {METHODS}: Here we show the analysis of the blood transcriptome of 22 schizophrenia patients before and after medication with atypical antipsychotics by next-generation sequencing. {RESULTS}: We found that 17 genes, among the 21 495 genes analyzed, have significantly-altered expression after medication (p-value adjusted [Padj] {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Six genes ({ADAMTS}2, {CD}177, {CNTNAP}3, {ENTPD}2, {RFX}2, and {UNC}45B) out of the 17 are among the 200 genes that we characterized with differential expression in a previous study between antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients and controls (Sainz et al., 2013). This number of schizophrenia-altered expression genes is significantly higher than expected by chance (Chi-test, Padj 1.19E-50), suggesting that at least part of the antipsychotic beneficial effects is exerted by modulating the expression of these genes. Interestingly, all six of these genes were overexpressed in patients and reverted to control levels of expression after treatment. We also found a significant enrichment of genes related to obesity and diabetes, known adverse affects of antipsychotics. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results may facilitate understanding of unknown molecular mechanisms behind schizophrenia symptoms and the molecular mechanisms of antipsychotic drugs. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author 2015.

Long interspersed element-1 ({LINE}-1 or L1) retrotransposition is known to create mosaicism by inserting L1 sequences into new locations of somatic cell genomes. Using a machine learning-based, single-cell sequencing approach, we discovered that somatic L1-associated variants ({SLAVs}) are composed of two classes: L1 retrotransposition insertions and retrotransposition-independent L1-associated variants. We demonstrate that a subset of {SLAVs} comprises somatic deletions generated by L1 endonuclease cutting activity. Retrotransposition-independent rearrangements in inherited L1s resulted in the deletion of proximal genomic regions. These rearrangements were resolved by microhomology-mediated repair, which suggests that L1-associated genomic regions are hotspots for somatic copy number variants in the brain and therefore a heritable genetic contributor to somatic mosaicism.

We found that gene-disruptive and putatively protein-damaging {URVs} (but not synonymous {URVs}) were more abundant among individuals with schizophrenia than among controls (P = 1.3 × 10-10). This elevation of protein-compromising {URVs} was several times larger than an analogously elevated rate for de novo mutations, suggesting that most rare-variant effects on schizophrenia risk are inherited. Among individuals with schizophrenia, the elevated frequency of protein-compromising {URVs} was concentrated in brain-expressed genes, particularly in neuronally expressed genes; most of this elevation arose from large sets of genes whose {RNAs} have been found to interact with synaptically localized proteins. Our results suggest that synaptic dysfunction may mediate a large fraction of strong, individually rare genetic influences on schizophrenia risk.},

Most neurons contain at least one gene-disrupting mutation and rare (0-2) mobile element insertions. The frequency and gene bias of neuronal mutations differ from other lineages, potentially due to novel mechanisms governing postmitotic mutation.

	abstract = {The discovery of neuroleptic drugs in 1952 provided a new strategy for seeking a biological basis of schizophrenia. This entailed a search for a primary site of neuroleptic action. The Parkinsonian effects caused by neuroleptics suggested that dopamine transmission may be disrupted by these drugs. In 1963 it was proposed that neuroleptics blocked "monoamine receptors" or impeded the release of monoamine metabolites. The neuroleptic concentration in plasma water or cerebrospinal fluid was of the order of 2 {nM} for haloperidol in clinical therapy. A systematic research was made between 1963 and 1974 for a primary site of neuroleptic action which would be sensitive to 2 {nM} haloperidol and stereoselective for (+)-butaclamol. Direct evidence that neuroleptics selectively blocked dopamine receptors occurred in 1974 with the finding that nanomolar concentrations of these drugs stereoselectively inhibited the binding of [3H]-dopamine or [3H]-haloperidol. These binding sites, now termed D2 dopamine receptors (which inhibit adenylate cyclase), are blocked by neuroleptics in direct relation to the antipsychotic potencies of the neuroleptics. No such correlation exists for D1 receptors (which stimulate adenylate cyclase). Based on the fact that dopamine-mimetic drugs elicited hallucinations, and that neuroleptics caused rigidity, Van Rossum in 1966 had suggested a hypothesis that dopamine pathways may be overactive in schizophrenia. The D2-selective blockade by all neuroleptics (except the monoamine-depleting reserpine) provided strong support for the dopamine hypothesis. Further support now comes from postmortem data and in vivo positron tomographic data, both of which indicate that the density of D2 receptors are elevated in the schizophrenic brain. The postmortem data indicate a bimodal pattern with half the schizophrenics having striatal D2 densities of 14 pmol/g (control is 13 pmol/g) and the other half having 26 pmol/g. Current positron tomographic data indicate D2 densities of 14 pmol/g in control subjects, but values of 34 pmol/g in drug-naive schizophrenics. Future tests of the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia may entail an examination of the amino acid composition and genes for D2 receptors in schizophrenic tissue, an examination of the ability of the D2 receptor to become phosphorylated and to desensitize into the low-affinity state, and an examination of the interaction of D2 receptors with D1 receptors or other neurotransmitters.},

We developed a complementary machine-learning approach based on a human brain-specific gene network to present a genome-wide prediction of autism risk genes, including hundreds of candidates for which there is minimal or no prior genetic evidence. Our approach was validated in a large independent case-control sequencing study. Leveraging these genome-wide predictions and the brain-specific network, we demonstrated that the large set of {ASD} genes converges on a smaller number of key pathways and developmental stages of the brain. Finally, we identified likely pathogenic genes within frequent autism-associated copy-number variants and proposed genes and pathways that are likely mediators of {ASD} across multiple copy-number variants.

This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes and leverages genome-wide information. Our findings include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits, a very large immunological disease-specific enrichment of heritability in {FANTOM}5 enhancers and many cell type-specific enrichments, including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in the heritability of body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment and smoking behavior.},

	abstract = {Most of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia ({SCZ}) has not yet been identified. Here, we apply a novel statistical algorithm called Covariate-Modulated Mixture Modeling ({CM}3), which incorporates auxiliary information (heterozygosity, total linkage disequilibrium, genomic annotations, pleiotropy) for each single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) to enable more accurate estimation of replication probabilities, conditional on the observed test statistic ("z-score") of the {SNP}. We use a multiple logistic regression on z-scores to combine information from auxiliary information to derive a "relative enrichment score" for each {SNP}. For each stratum of these relative enrichment scores, we obtain nonparametric estimates of posterior expected test statistics and replication probabilities as a function of discovery z-scores, using a resampling-based approach that repeatedly and randomly partitions meta-analysis sub-studies into training and replication samples. We fit a scale mixture of two Gaussians model to each stratum, obtaining parameter estimates that minimize the sum of squared differences of the scale-mixture model with the stratified nonparametric estimates. We apply this approach to the recent genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) of {SCZ} (n = 82,315), obtaining a good fit between the model-based and observed effect sizes and replication probabilities. We observed that {SNPs} with low enrichment scores replicate with a lower probability than {SNPs} with high enrichment scores even when both they are genome-wide significant (p {\textbackslash}textless 5x10-8). There were 693 and 219 independent loci with model-based replication rates ≥80\% and ≥90\%, respectively. Compared to analyses not incorporating relative enrichment scores, {CM}3 increased out-of-sample yield for {SNPs} that replicate at a given rate. This demonstrates that replication probabilities can be more accurately estimated using prior enrichment information with {CM}3.},

To understand how genetic variation and natural selection contribute to these differences, we tested for the effects of African versus European ancestry on the transcriptional response of primary macrophages to live bacterial pathogens. A total of 9.3\% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection, and African ancestry specifically predicts a stronger inflammatory response and reduced intracellular bacterial growth. A large proportion of these differences are under genetic control: for 804 genes, more than 75\% of ancestry effects on the immune response can be explained by a single cis- or trans-acting expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}). Finally, we show that genetic effects on the immune response are strongly enriched for recent, population-specific signatures of adaptation. Together, our results demonstrate how historical selective events continue to shape human phenotypic diversity today, including for traits that are key to controlling infection.

Two competing, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses are that {ASD} risk genes are sex-differentially regulated, or alternatively, that they interact with characteristic sexually dimorphic pathways. Here we characterized sexually dimorphic gene expression in multiple data sets from neurotypical adult and prenatal human neocortical tissue, and evaluated {ASD} risk genes for evidence of sex-biased expression. We find no evidence for systematic sex-differential expression of {ASD} risk genes. Instead, we observe that genes expressed at higher levels in males are significantly enriched for genes upregulated in post-mortem autistic brain, including astrocyte and microglia markers. This suggests that it is not sex-differential regulation of {ASD} risk genes, but rather naturally occurring sexually dimorphic processes, potentially including neuron-glial interactions, that modulate the impact of risk variants and contribute to the sex-skewed prevalence of {ASD}.},

Here we present a comprehensive analysis to reveal the sex differences in gene expression in schizophrenia with stringent statistics criteria.

When we tested for a sex by diagnosis interaction on gene expression, 23 genes were up-regulated and 23 genes were down-regulated in the male group (q-value {\textbackslash}textless 0.05), several genes are related to energy metabolism, while 4 genes are located on sex chromosome. No genes were statistically significant in the female group when multiple testing correction were conducted (q-value {\textbackslash}textless 0.05), most likely due to the small sample size.

In humans, approximately 15 \% of genes consistently escape from this inactivation and another 15 \% of genes vary between individuals or tissues in whether they are subject to, or escape from, inactivation. Multiple studies have provided inactivation status calls for a large subset of the genes on the X chromosome; however, these studies vary in which genes they were able to make calls for and in some cases which call they give a specific gene. {METHODS}: This analysis aggregated three published studies that have examined X chromosome inactivation status of genes across the X chromosome, generating consensus calls and identifying discordancies. The impact of expression level and chromosomal location on X chromosome inactivation status was also assessed. {RESULTS}: Overall, we assigned a consensus {XCI} status 639 genes, including 78 \% of protein-coding genes expressed outside of the testes, with a lower frequency for non-coding {RNA} and testis-specific genes. Study-specific discordancies suggest that there may be instability of {XCI} during cell culture and also highlight study-specific variations in call type. We observe an enrichment of discordant genes at boundaries between genes subject to and escaping from inactivation. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study has compiled a comprehensive list of X-chromosome inactivation statuses for genes and also discovered some biases which will help guide future studies examining X-chromosome inactivation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) has become a very widely used technology for profiling gene expression. One of the most common aims of {RNA}-seq profiling is to identify genes or molecular pathways that are differentially expressed ({DE}) between two or more biological conditions. This article demonstrates a computational workflow for the detection of {DE} genes and pathways from {RNA}-seq data by providing a complete analysis of an {RNA}-seq experiment profiling epithelial cell subsets in the mouse mammary gland. The workflow uses R software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project and covers all steps of the analysis pipeline, including alignment of read sequences, data exploration, differential expression analysis, visualization and pathway analysis. Read alignment and count quantification is conducted using the Rsubread package and the statistical analyses are performed using the {edgeR} package. The differential expression analysis uses the quasi-likelihood functionality of {edgeR}.},

	abstract = {Exposure to early-life stress ({ELS}) may heighten the risk for psychopathology at adulthood. Here, in order to identify common genes that may keep the memory of {ELS} through changes in their methylation status, we intersected methylome analyses performed in different tissues and time points in rats, non-human primates and humans, all characterized by {ELS}. We identified Ankyrin-3 (Ank3), a scaffolding protein with a strong genetic association for psychiatric disorders, as a gene persistently affected by stress exposure. In rats, Ank3 methylation and {mRNA} changes displayed a specific temporal profile during the postnatal development. Moreover, exposure to prenatal stress altered the interaction of ankyrin-G, the protein encoded by Ank3 enriched in the post-synaptic compartment, with {PSD}95. Notably, to model in humans a gene by early stress interplay on brain phenotypes during cognitive performance, we demonstrated an interaction between functional variation in Ank3 gene and obstetric complications on working memory in healthy adult subjects. Our data suggest that alterations of Ank3 expression and function may contribute to the effects of {ELS} on the development of psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {The role of lateral gene transfer ({LGT}) in prokaryotes has been shown to rapidly change the genome content, providing new gene tools for environmental adaptation. Features related to pathogenesis and resistance to strong selective conditions have been widely shown to be products of gene transfer between bacteria. The genomes of the gamma-proteobacteria from the genus Xanthomonas, composed mainly of phytopathogens, have potential genomic islands that may represent imprints of such evolutionary processes. In this work, the evolution of genes involved in the pathway responsible for arginine biosynthesis in Xanthomonadales was investigated, and several lines of evidence point to the foreign origin of the arg genes clustered within a potential operon. Their presence inside a potential genomic island, bordered by a {tRNA} gene, the unusual ranking of sequence similarity, and the atypical phylogenies indicate that the metabolic pathway for arginine biosynthesis was acquired through {LGT} in the Xanthomonadales group. Moreover, although homologues were also found in Bacteroidetes (Flavobacteria group), for many of the genes analyzed close homologues are detected in different life domains (Eukarya and Archaea), indicating that the source of these arg genes may have been outside the Bacteria clade. The possibility of replacement of a complete primary metabolic pathway by {LGT} events supports the selfish operon hypothesis and may occur only under very special environmental conditions. Such rare events reveal part of the history of these interesting mosaic Xanthomonadales genomes, disclosing the importance of gene transfer modifying primary metabolism pathways and extending the scenario for bacterial genome evolution.},

	abstract = {Although bacterial species display wide variation in their overall {GC} contents, the genes within a particular species' genome are relatively similar in base composition. As a result, sequences that are novel to a bacterial genome-i.e., {DNA} introduced through recent horizontal transfer-often bear unusual sequence characteristics and can be distinguished from ancestral {DNA}. At the time of introgression, horizontally transferred genes reflect the base composition of the donor genome; but, over time, these sequences will ameliorate to reflect the {DNA} composition of the new genome because the introgressed genes are subject to the same mutational processes affecting all genes in the recipient genome. This process of amelioration is evident in a large group of genes involved in host-cell invasion by enteric bacteria and can be modeled to predict the amount of time required after transfer for foreign {DNA} to resemble native {DNA}. Furthermore, models of amelioration can be used to estimate the time of introgression of foreign genes in a chromosome. Applying this approach to a 1.43-megabase continuous sequence, we have calculated that the entire Escherichia coli chromosome contains more than 600 kb of horizontally transferred, protein-coding {DNA}. Estimates of amelioration times indicate that this {DNA} has accumulated at a rate of 31 kb per million years, which is on the order of the amount of variant {DNA} introduced by point mutations. This rate predicts that the E. coli and Salmonella enterica lineages have each gained and lost more than 3 megabases of novel {DNA} since their divergence.},

To further our understanding of sex differences in transcriptional regulation, we performed meta-analyses of sex biased gene expression in multiple human tissues. We analyzed 22 publicly available human gene expression microarray data sets including over 2500 samples from 15 different tissues and 9 different organs. Briefly, by using an inverse-variance method we determined the effect size difference of gene expression between males and females. We found the greatest sex differences in gene expression in the brain, specifically in the anterior cingulate cortex, (1818 genes), followed by the heart (375 genes), kidney (224 genes), colon (218 genes), and thyroid (163 genes). More interestingly, we found different parts of the brain with varying numbers and identity of sex-biased genes, indicating that specific cortical regions may influence sexually dimorphic traits. The majority of sex-biased genes in other tissues such as the bladder, liver, lungs, and pancreas were on the sex chromosomes or involved in sex hormone production. On average in each tissue, 32\% of autosomal genes that were expressed in a sex-biased fashion contained androgen or estrogen hormone response elements. Interestingly, across all tissues, we found approximately two-thirds of autosomal genes that were sex-biased were not under direct influence of sex hormones. To our knowledge this is the largest analysis of sex-biased gene expression in human tissues to date. We identified many sex-biased genes that were not under the direct influence of sex chromosome genes or sex hormones. These may provide targets for future development of sex-specific treatments for diseases.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Male gender and young age at onset of schizophrenia are traditionally associated with poor treatment outcome and often used to determine prognosis. However, many studies use nonincident samples and fail to adjust for symptom severity at onset. We hypothesized that age and gender would influence severity of presentation but would not predict outcome after adjustment for symptoms at presentation. {METHOD}: 628 people with first-episode {ICD}-9 and {DSM}-{IV} nonaffective psychosis from 2 historical cohorts recruited from sequential presentations in Canada and the United Kingdom (1996-1998) were assessed prospectively at presentation and over 12-18 months using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ({PAN}{\textbackslash}{SS}). {RESULTS}: Models of the age-at-onset distributions with 2 underlying modes at similar ages in women (ages 23 years and 47 years) and men (ages 22 years and 46 years) had relatively good fits compared to single-mode models ({\textbackslash}chi(2)1 better by 9.2 for females, 8.0 for males, both P {\textbackslash}textless .05). At presentation, scores for negative symptoms were 1.84 points worse for males (95\% {CI}, 1.05 to 2.58; P {\textbackslash}textless .001) in a mixed effects model. Younger age also predicted higher negative scores at presentation (partial correlation r = -0.18, P {\textbackslash}textless .01; P {\textbackslash}textless .001 in the mixed effects model). Findings were similar for cognitive-disorganized symptoms. However, after controlling for baseline symptoms, age at onset and gender did not significantly predict subsequent symptom course in the mixed effects models. {CONCLUSIONS}: Gender and age at onset are independently associated with symptoms at presentation but not with medium-term course of schizophrenia. This finding reinforces the importance of early identification and prevention of severe negative symptoms at first episode, whatever an individual's age and gender. {\textbackslash}copyright Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.},

To contribute to the knowledge in this regard, the objective of this report was to characterize the particular expression level of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in young male and female rats. Striatum ({STR}) and frontal cortex ({CTX}) were obtained from intact 30-days old animals, and the D1 and D2 expression level was analyzed by Western blot. The results show a greater expression of D1, but less of D2, in female {CTX} compared with males, whereas in {STR}, both D1 and D2 receptors shows predominance in females. These results support the evidence of dimorphic expression in dopaminergic markers, outside of the sex-related brain nuclei, and suggests an early effect of hormones in establishing long life characteristics in dopaminergic circuits.

Inference of locus-specific ancestry is key to our understanding of the genetic variation of such populations. While a number of methods for the inference of locus-specific ancestry are accurate when the ancestral populations are quite distant (e.g. African-Americans), current methods incur a large error rate when inferring the locus-specific ancestry in admixed populations where the ancestral populations are closely related (e.g. Americans of European descent). {RESULTS}: In this work, we extend previous methods for the inference of locus-specific ancestry by the incorporation of a refined model of recombination events. We present an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to infer the locus-specific ancestries in this model, resulting in a method that attains improved accuracies; the improvement is most significant when the ancestral populations are closely related. An evaluation on a wide range of scenarios, including admixtures of the 52 population groups from the Human Genome Diversity Project demonstrates that locus-specific ancestry can indeed be accurately inferred in these admixtures using our method. Finally, we demonstrate that imputation methods can be improved by the incorporation of locus-specific ancestry, when applied to admixed populations. {AVAILABILITY}: The implementation of the {WINPOP} model is available as part of the {LAMP} package at http://lamp.icsi.berkeley.edu/lamp.},

The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods ({DREAM}) challenge aims to evaluate the success of {GRN} inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present {GENIE}3, a new algorithm for the inference of {GRNs} that was best performer in the {DREAM}4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. {GENIE}3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the {DREAM}4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that {GENIE}3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed {GRNs}, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for {GRN} inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

	abstract = {Angiotensin {II} ({AngII}), the major effector peptide of renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}), is now recognized as a growth factor that regulates cell growth and fibrosis, besides being a physiological mediator restoring circulatory integrity. In the last few years, a large number of experimental studies has further demonstrated that {AngII} is involved in key events of the inflammatory process. Here, we summarize the wide variety of {AngII} functions and discuss them in relation with the inflammatory cascade. {AngII} increases vascular permeability (via the release of prostaglandins and vascular endothelial cell growth factor or rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins) that initiates the inflammatory process. {AngII} could contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the tissue through the regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokines by resident cells. Moreover, {AngII} could directly activate infiltrating immunocompetent cells, including chemotaxis, differentiation and proliferation. Recent data also suggest that {RAS} activation could play a certain role even in immunologically-induced inflammation. Transcriptional regulation, predominantly via nuclear factor-{kappaB} ({NF}-{kappaB}) and {AP}-1 activation, and second mediator systems, such as endothelin-1, the small G protein (Rho) and redox-pathways are shown to be involved in the molecular mechanism by which {AngII} exerts those functions. Finally, {AngII} participates in tissue repair and remodeling, through the regulation of cell growth and matrix synthesis. In summary, recent data support the hypothesis that {RAS} is key mediator of inflammation. Further understanding of the role of the {RAS} in this process may provide important opportunities for clinical research and treatment of inflammatory diseases.},

	abstract = {The method of Hidden Markov Models is used to allow for unequal and unknown evolutionary rates at different sites in molecular sequences. Rates of evolution at different sites are assumed to be drawn from a set of possible rates, with a finite number of possibilities. The overall likelihood of phylogeny is calculated as a sum of terms, each term being the probability of the data given a particular assignment of rates to sites, times the prior probability of that particular combination of rates. The probabilities of different rate combinations are specified by a stationary Markov chain that assigns rate categories to sites. While there will be a very large number of possible ways of assigning rates to sites, a simple recursive algorithm allows the contributions to the likelihood from all possible combinations of rates to be summed, in a time proportional to the number of different rates at a single site. Thus with three rates, the effort involved is no greater than three times that for a single rate. This "Hidden Markov Model" method allows for rates to differ between sites and for correlations between the rates of neighboring sites. By summing over all possibilities it does not require us to know the rates at individual sites. However, it does not allow for correlation of rates at nonadjacent sites, nor does it allow for a continuous distribution of rates over sites. It is shown how to use the Newton-Raphson method to estimate branch lengths of a phylogeny and to infer from a phylogeny what assignment of rates to sites has the largest posterior probability. An example is given using beta-hemoglobin {DNA} sequences in eight mammal species; the regions of high and low evolutionary rates are inferred and also the average length of patches of similar rates.},

The remaining 60-80\% is shaped by intrinsic factors, with age being the predominant factor, as well as by environmental influences, where cohabitation and chronic viral infections were identified as key mediators.

However, how these differences were manifested during development and maintained through adulthood are still unclear. Here we present a time series analyses of genome-wide transcription profiles of the human brain, and we identified genes showing sex biased expression at major developmental stages (prenatal time, early childhood, puberty time and adulthood). We observed a great number of genes ({\textbackslash}textgreater2,000 genes) showing between-sex expression divergence at all developmental stages with the greatest number (4,164 genes) at puberty time. However, there are little overlap of sex-biased genes among the major developmental stages, an indication of dynamic expression regulation of the sex-biased genes in the brain during development. Notably, the male biased genes are highly enriched for genes involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease and autism, while no such pattern was seen for the female-biased genes, suggesting that the differences in brain disorder susceptibility between males and females are likely rooted from the sex-biased gene expression regulation during brain development. Collectively, these analyses reveal an important role of sex biased genes in brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is the seventh leading cause of all deaths in the United States and is virtually tied with the sixth leading cause of death-diabetes. {AD} is the fifth leading cause of death in Americans aged 65 and older. Although other major causes of death have been on the decrease, deaths because of {AD} have been rising dramatically. Between 2000 and 2006, heart disease deaths decreased 11.1\%, stroke deaths decreased 18.2\%, and prostate cancer-related deaths decreased 8.7\%, whereas deaths because of {AD} increased 46.1\%. Older African-Americans and Hispanics are more likely than older white Americans to have {AD} or other dementia. Current estimates are that African-Americans are about 2 times more likely, and Hispanics about 1.5 times more likely, than their white counterparts to have these conditions. However, the relationship of race and ethnicity to the development of {AD} and other dementias is complex and not fully understood. In 2009, nearly 11 million family and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 12.5 billion hours of care to persons with {AD} and other dementias; this care is valued at nearly {\textbackslash}144 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with {AD} and other dementias are three times higher than for beneficiaries without these conditions. Total payments for 2010 for health care and long-term care services for people aged 65 and older with {AD} and other dementias are expected to be {\textbackslash}172 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 5.3 million Americans have {AD}; approximately 200,000 persons under age 65 with {AD} comprise the younger-onset {AD} population. Every 70 seconds, someone in America develops {AD}; by 2050 the time of every 70 seconds is expected to decrease to every 33 seconds. Over the coming decades, the baby boom population is projected to add 10 million people to these numbers. In 2050, the incidence of {AD} is expected to approach nearly a million people per year, with a total estimated prevalence of 11-16 million people. Dramatic increases in the numbers of "oldest old" (aged 85 years and older) across all racial and ethnic groups will also significantly affect the numbers of people living with {AD}. This report provides information to increase understanding of the public health effect of {AD}, including incidence and prevalence, mortality, costs of care, and effect on caregivers and society in general.

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Most societies believe that a mother's psychological state can influence her unborn baby. Severe adverse life events during pregnancy have been consistently associated with an elevated risk of low birth weight and prematurity. Such events during the first trimester have also been associated with risk of congenital malformations. {OBJECTIVE}: To assess the effect in offspring of antenatal maternal exposure to an objective measure of stress on risk of adverse neurodevelopment, specifically schizophrenia. We hypothesized that the strongest relationship would be to maternal exposures during the first trimester. {DESIGN}: Population-based study. {SETTING}: Denmark. {PARTICIPANTS}: In a cohort of 1.38 million Danish births from 1973 to 1995, mothers were considered exposed if 1 (or more) of their close relatives died or was diagnosed with cancer, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke syndrome up to 6 months before conception or during pregnancy. Offspring were followed up from their 10th birthday until their death, migration, onset of schizophrenia, or June 30, 2005; admissions were identified by linkage to the Central Psychiatric Register. Main Outcome Measure Schizophrenia. {RESULTS}: The risk of schizophrenia and related disorders was raised in offspring whose mothers were exposed to death of a relative during the first trimester (adjusted relative risk, 1.67 [95\% confidence interval, 1.02-2.73]). Death of a relative during other trimesters or up to 6 months before pregnancy were not linked with a higher risk of schizophrenia. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our population-based study suggests that severe stress to a mother during the first trimester may alter the risk of schizophrenia in offspring. This finding is consistent with ecological evidence from whole populations exposed to severe stressors and suggests that environment may influence neurodevelopment at the feto-placental-maternal interface.},

A pathophysiological model of the relationship between schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia was developed based on this data. {METHOD}: The authors provide a selective review of major findings regarding the pathophysiology of schizotypal personality disorder and integrate these results in conjunction with preclinical studies into a model of the pathophysiology of the spectrum. {RESULTS}: People with schizotypal personality disorder share phenomenological, genetic, and cognitive abnormalities with people with chronic schizophrenia. While temporal volume reductions appear to be common to both groups, there may be preservation of frontal lobe volume in schizotypal personality disorder compared to schizophrenia. Findings to date regarding striatal volume, metabolic rate, and dopamine release in subjects with schizotypal personality disorder compared to subjects with chronic schizophrenia are consistent with hypotheses of reduced striatal dopaminergic activity in schizotypal personality disorder compared to schizophrenia. {CONCLUSIONS}: Genetic or environmental factors that promote greater frontal capacity and reduced striatal dopaminergic reactivity might contribute to sparing people with schizotypal personality disorder from the psychosis and severe social and cognitive deterioration of chronic schizophrenia.

Two intronic single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs} rs2283265 (intron 5) and rs1076560 (intron 6)) in high linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) with each other have been reported to alter D2S/D2L splicing and several behavioral traits in human subjects, such as memory processing. To assess the role of {DRD}2 variants in cocaine abuse, we measured levels of D2S and D2L {mRNA} in human brain autopsy tissues (prefrontal cortex and putamen) obtained from cocaine abusers and controls, and genotyped a panel of {DRD}2 {SNPs} (119 abusers and 95 controls). Robust effects of rs2283265 and rs1076560 on reducing formation of D2S relative to D2L were confirmed. The minor alleles of rs2283265/rs1076560 were considerably more frequent in Caucasians (18\%) compared with African Americans (7\%). Also, in Caucasians, rs2283265/rs1076560 minor alleles were significantly overrepresented in cocaine abusers compared with controls (rs2283265: 25 to 9\%, respectively; p=0.001; {OR}=3.4 (1.7-7.1)). Several {SNPs} previously implicated in diverse clinical association studies are in high {LD} with rs2283265/rs1076560 and could have served as surrogate markers.

Several recent studies have analyzed gene expression levels in populations of different continental ancestry and reported population differences at a large number of genes. However, these differences could largely be due to non-genetic (e.g., environmental) effects. Here, we analyze gene expression levels in African American cell lines, which differ from previously analyzed cell lines in that individuals from this population inherit variable proportions of two continental ancestries. We first relate gene expression levels in individual African Americans to their genome-wide proportion of European ancestry. The results provide strong evidence of a genetic contribution to expression differences between European and African populations, validating previous findings. Second, we infer local ancestry (0, 1, or 2 European chromosomes) at each location in the genome and investigate the effects of ancestry proximal to the expressed gene (cis) versus ancestry elsewhere in the genome (trans). Both effects are highly significant, and we estimate that 12+/-3\% of all heritable variation in human gene expression is due to cis variants.},

The increases in receptors were seen only in patients in whom neuroleptic medication had been maintained until the time of death, indicating that they may be entirely iatrogenic. Dopamine measurements for a larger series of schizophrenic and control cases (n greater than 60) show significantly increased concentrations in both the nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus.

Current techniques to compare expression profiles typically involve choosing a fixed differential expression threshold to summarize results, potentially reducing sensitivity to small but concordant changes. We present a threshold-free algorithm called Rank-rank Hypergeometric Overlap ({RRHO}). This algorithm steps through two gene lists ranked by the degree of differential expression observed in two profiling experiments, successively measuring the statistical significance of the number of overlapping genes. The output is a graphical map that shows the strength, pattern and bounds of correlation between two expression profiles. To demonstrate {RRHO} sensitivity and dynamic range, we identified shared expression networks in cancer microarray profiles driving tumor progression, stem cell properties and response to targeted kinase inhibition. We demonstrate how {RRHO} can be used to determine which model system or drug treatment best reflects a particular biological or disease response. The threshold-free and graphical aspects of {RRHO} complement other rank-based approaches such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ({GSEA}), for which {RRHO} is a 2D analog. Rank-rank overlap analysis is a sensitive, robust and web-accessible method for detecting and visualizing overlap trends between two complete, continuous gene-expression profiles.

	abstract = {The expansion of genome sequencing projects has produced accumulating evidence for lateral transfer of genes between prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. However, it remains controversial whether these genes are of functional importance in their recipient host. Nikoh and Nakabachi, in a recent paper in {BMC} Biology, take a first step and show that two genes of bacterial origin are highly expressed in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Active gene expression of transferred genes is supported by three other recent studies. Future studies should reveal whether functional proteins are produced and whether and how these are targeted to the appropriate compartment. We argue that the transfer of genes between host and symbiont may occasionally be of great evolutionary importance, particularly in the evolution of the symbiotic interaction itself.},

Phasing is generally performed via statistical phasing in a genotyped cohort, an approach that can yield high accuracy in very large cohorts but attains lower accuracy in smaller cohorts. Here we instead explore the paradigm of reference-based phasing. We introduce a new phasing algorithm, Eagle2, that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium; {HRC}) using a new data structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform. We demonstrate that Eagle2 attains a ∼20× speedup and ∼10\% increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using {SHAPEIT}2. On European-ancestry samples, Eagle2 with the {HRC} panel achieves {\textbackslash}textgreater2× the accuracy of 1000 Genomes-based phasing.

	abstract = {Differential expression analysis of {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. We previously introduced an intermediate statistical approach called differentially expressed region ({DER}) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution without relying on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript assembly.We present the derfinder software that improves our annotation-agnostic approach to {RNA}-seq analysis by: (i) implementing a computationally efficient bump-hunting approach to identify {DERs} that permits genome-scale analyses in a large number of samples, (ii) introducing a flexible statistical modeling framework, including multi-group and time-course analyses and (iii) introducing a new set of data visualizations for expressed region analysis. We apply this approach to public {RNA}-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) project and {BrainSpan} project to show that derfinder permits the analysis of hundreds of samples at base resolution in R, identifies expression outside of known gene boundaries and can be used to visualize expressed regions at base-resolution. In simulations, our base resolution approaches enable discovery in the presence of incomplete annotation and is nearly as powerful as feature-level methods when the annotation is complete.derfinder analysis using expressed region-level and single base-level approaches provides a compromise between full transcript reconstruction and feature-level analysis.

However, most of these susceptibility variants are located in noncoding genomic regions that usually span multiple genes. As a result, pinpointing the precise variant(s) and biological mechanisms accounting for the risk remains challenging. By reviewing recent progresses in genetics, functional genomics and neurobiology of psychiatric disorders, as well as gene expression analyses of brain tissues, here we propose a roadmap to characterize the roles of noncoding risk loci in the pathogenesis of psychiatric illnesses (that is, identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms explaining the genetic risk conferred by those genomic loci, and recognizing putative functional causative variants). This roadmap involves integration of transcriptomic data, epidemiological and bioinformatic methods, as well as in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches. These tools will promote the translation of genetic discoveries to physiological mechanisms, and ultimately guide the development of preventive, therapeutic and prognostic measures for psychiatric disorders.},

To delineate drug development (including repurposing) opportunities arising from this paradigm, we connected complex disease- and biomarker-associated loci from genome-wide association studies to an updated set of genes encoding druggable human proteins, to agents with bioactivity against these targets, and, where there were licensed drugs, to clinical indications.

Here, we introduce a method for estimating the local genetic correlation between gene expression and a complex trait and utilize it to estimate the genetic correlation due to predicted expression between pairs of traits. We integrated gene expression measurements from 45 expression panels with summary {GWAS} data to perform 30 multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies ({TWASs}). We identified 1,196 genes whose expression is associated with these traits; of these, 168 reside more than 0.5 Mb away from any previously reported {GWAS} significant variant. We then used our approach to find 43 pairs of traits with significant genetic correlation at the level of predicted expression; of these, eight were not found through genetic correlation at the {SNP} level. Finally, we used bi-directional regression to find evidence that {BMI} causally influences triglyceride levels and that triglyceride levels causally influence low-density lipoprotein. Together, our results provide insight into the role of gene expression in the susceptibility of complex traits and diseases.

To determine the spectrum of symptoms and signs as well as the frequency of cancer in adult patients who are seropositive for {ANNA}-1, we reviewed 162 sequential patients (67\% female) identified as {ANNA}-1-positive in a comprehensive immunofluorescence screening test. In 21\% of these patients, the antibody test requested by the physician was not {ANNA}-1. By the end of the follow-up period, cancer had been found in 142 patients (88\%). Ten of these lacked evidence of {SCLC} (4 had prostate carcinoma, 3 breast carcinoma, 1 both prostate carcinoma and melanoma, 1 lymphoma, and 1 squamous-cell lung carcinoma). Of the 132 patients (81\%) with proven {SCLC}, 17 had one or more coexisting malignant neoplasms (6 had renal carcinoma, 4 another lung primary carcinoma, 3 prostate carcinoma, 3 breast carcinoma, and 4 assorted neoplasms). The diagnosis of {SCLC} in 128 patients (97\%) followed the onset of paraneoplastic symptoms. {SCLC} was identified in 10 patients by chest {MRI} after an equivocal chest radiograph or {CT}; in 28 by bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or thoracotomy; and in 7 at autopsy. Neurologic signs in decreasing frequency were neuropathy (sensory {\textbackslash}textgreater mixed somatic {\textbackslash}textgreater autonomic {\textbackslash}textgreater cranial [especially cranial nerve {VIII}] {\textbackslash}textgreater motor), cerebellar ataxia, limbic encephalitis, polyradiculopathy, associated Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, myopathy, myelopathy, opsoclonus/myoclonus, motor neuronopathy, brachial plexopathy, and aphasia. Nineteen patients had a solely gastrointestinal initial presentation, including gastroparesis, pseudo-obstruction, esophageal achalasia, or other dysmotility.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: To examine the range of clinical phenotypes, tumour associations, relevant investigations, response to therapy and outcome in a large series of non-selected patients with paraneoplastic neurological disease ({PND}) affecting the central nervous system ({CNS}) in the United Kingdom. {METHODS}: Data were obtained on patients either through direct referral or through the British Neurological Surveillance Unit ({BNSU}) from February 2000 to January 2001. Physicians were asked to supply information about age and sex of patients, presenting neurological syndromes, the basis of the diagnosis of {PND}, any associated malignancy, and treatment. Case notes were reviewed and follow up data obtained where possible one year after notification. {RESULTS}: A total of 63 patients (48 females, 15 males) were identified, 48 through the {BNSU} and 15 through direct referral. Of these 52 were diagnosed as having definite {PND}, 10 probable {PND}, and 1 possible {PND}. The median age of onset of {PND} was 66 years (range 30-80 years) and only 7 patients (11\%) were less than 50 years at presentation. In 53 patients (84\%) the {PND} preceded the diagnosis of cancer. Paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy, paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration ({PCD}) were the most common syndromes reported. The benefit of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of the disease was limited, while fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was shown to be useful for the detection of an occult malignancy in 10 out of 14 patients. Antineuronal antibodies were positive in 44/57 (77\%) of cases. The following tumours were diagnosed: small cell lung cancer (30\%), breast cancer (14\%), ovarian cancer (8\%), non-small cell lung cancer (8\%), Hodgkin's lymphoma (6\%), other (16\%). With the exception of {PCD} associated with mesothelioma all other tumours diagnosed in these patients had been previously documented as being associated with {PND}. Only treatment of the tumour was found to be associated with a stable or improved neurological outcome at last follow up (Fisher's exact test = 4.7, p{\textbackslash}textless 0.03). Median survival time was 43 months (95\% {CI} 28 to 57) from onset of neurological disease as calculated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. {CONCLUSIONS}: {PND} has a striking female preponderance usually affecting patients in their sixth decade and above. The median survival in our study was 43 months. The majority of patients with {PND} are not known to have cancer at the time of diagnosis. Our study confirms the importance of diagnosing and treating the underlying tumour.},

Here we apply a telescoping multiprotein approach to the problem for 104 diverse gammaproteobacterial genomes, based on a set of 356 protein families for the whole class and even larger sets for each of four cohesive subregions of the tree. Although the deepest divergences were resistant to full resolution, some surprising patterns were strongly supported. A representative of the Acidithiobacillales routinely appeared among the outgroup members, suggesting that in conflict with {rRNA}-based phylogenies this order does not belong to Gammaproteobacteria; instead, it (and, independently, "Mariprofundus") diverged after the establishment of the Alphaproteobacteria yet before the betaproteobacteria/gammaproteobacteria split. None of the orders Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, or Oceanospirillales were monophyletic; we obtained strong support for clades that contain some but exclude other members of all three orders. Extreme amino acid bias in the highly A+T-rich genome of Candidatus Carsonella prevented its reliable placement within Gammaproteobacteria, and high bias caused artifacts that limited the resolution of the relationships of other insect endosymbionts, which appear to have had multiple origins, although the unbiased genome of the endosymbiont Sodalis acted as an attractor for them. Instability was observed for the root of the Enterobacteriales, with nearly equal subsets of the protein families favoring one or the other of two alternative root positions; the nematode symbiont Photorhabdus was identified as a disruptor whose omission helped stabilize the Enterobacteriales root.},

	abstract = {One of the most common analysis tasks in genomic research is to identify genes that are differentially expressed ({DE}) between experimental conditions. Empirical Bayes ({EB}) statistical tests using moderated genewise variances have been very effective for this purpose, especially when the number of biological replicate samples is small. The {EB} procedures can however be heavily influenced by a small number of genes with very large or very small variances. This article improves the differential expression tests by robustifying the hyperparameter estimation procedure. The robust procedure has the effect of decreasing the informativeness of the prior distribution for outlier genes while increasing its informativeness for other genes. This effect has the double benefit of reducing the chance that hypervariable genes will be spuriously identified as {DE} while increasing statistical power for the main body of genes. The robust {EB} algorithm is fast and numerically stable. The procedure allows exact small-sample null distributions for the test statistics and reduces exactly to the original {EB} procedure when no outlier genes are present. Simulations show that the robustified tests have similar performance to the original tests in the absence of outlier genes but have greater power and robustness when outliers are present. The article includes case studies for which the robust method correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with hidden covariates and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

In this conceptual report, the third in a Series on equity and equality in health in the {USA}, we use a contemporary and historical perspective to discuss research and interventions that grapple with the implications of what is known as structural racism on population health and health inequities. Structural racism refers to the totality of ways in which societies foster racial discrimination through mutually reinforcing systems of housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit, media, health care, and criminal justice. These patterns and practices in turn reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values, and distribution of resources. We argue that a focus on structural racism offers a concrete, feasible, and promising approach towards advancing health equity and improving population health.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: We have developed a new computational algorithm, Shape-{IT}, to infer haplotypes under the genetic model of coalescence with recombination developed by Stephens et al in Phase v2.1. It runs much faster than Phase v2.1 while exhibiting the same accuracy. The major algorithmic improvements rely on the use of binary trees to represent the sets of candidate haplotypes for each individual. These binary tree representations: (1) speed up the computations of posterior probabilities of the haplotypes by avoiding the redundant operations made in Phase v2.1, and (2) overcome the exponential aspect of the haplotypes inference problem by the smart exploration of the most plausible pathways (ie. haplotypes) in the binary trees. {RESULTS}: Our results show that Shape-{IT} is several orders of magnitude faster than Phase v2.1 while being as accurate. For instance, Shape-{IT} runs 50 times faster than Phase v2.1 to compute the haplotypes of 200 subjects on 6,000 segments of 50 {SNPs} extracted from a standard Illumina 300 K chip (13 days instead of 630 days). We also compared Shape-{IT} with other widely used software, Gerbil, {PL}-{EM}, Fastphase, 2SNP, and Ishape in various tests: Shape-{IT} and Phase v2.1 were the most accurate in all cases, followed by Ishape and Fastphase. As a matter of speed, Shape-{IT} was faster than Ishape and Fastphase for datasets smaller than 100 {SNPs}, but Fastphase became faster -but still less accurate- to infer haplotypes on larger {SNP} datasets. {CONCLUSION}: Shape-{IT} deserves to be extensively used for regular haplotype inference but also in the context of the new high-throughput genotyping chips since it permits to fit the genetic model of Phase v2.1 on large datasets. This new algorithm based on tree representations could be used in other {HMM}-based haplotype inference software and may apply more largely to other fields using {HMM}.},

	abstract = {Normalization is an essential step with considerable impact on high-throughput {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) data analysis. Although there are numerous methods for read count normalization, it remains a challenge to choose an optimal method due to multiple factors contributing to read count variability that affects the overall sensitivity and specificity. In order to properly determine the most appropriate normalization methods, it is critical to compare the performance and shortcomings of a representative set of normalization routines based on different dataset characteristics. Therefore, we set out to evaluate the performance of the commonly used methods ({DESeq}, {TMM}-{edgeR}, {FPKM}-{CuffDiff}, {TC}, Med {UQ} and {FQ}) and two new methods we propose: Med-{pgQ}2 and {UQ}-{pgQ}2 (per-gene normalization after per-sample median or upper-quartile global scaling). Our per-gene normalization approach allows for comparisons between conditions based on similar count levels. Using the benchmark Microarray Quality Control Project ({MAQC}) and simulated datasets, we performed differential gene expression analysis to evaluate these methods. When evaluating {MAQC}2 with two replicates, we observed that Med-{pgQ}2 and {UQ}-{pgQ}2 achieved a slightly higher area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve ({AUC}), a specificity rate {\textbackslash}textgreater 85\%, the detection power {\textbackslash}textgreater 92\% and an actual false discovery rate ({FDR}) under 0.06 given the nominal {FDR} (≤0.05). Although the top commonly used methods ({DESeq} and {TMM}-{edgeR}) yield a higher power ({\textbackslash}textgreater93\%) for {MAQC}2 data, they trade off with a reduced specificity ({\textbackslash}textless 70\%) and a slightly higher actual {FDR} than our proposed methods. In addition, the results from an analysis based on the qualitative characteristics of sample distribution for {MAQC}2 and human breast cancer datasets show that only our gene-wise normalization methods corrected data skewed towards lower read counts. However, when we evaluated {MAQC}3 with less variation in five replicates, all methods performed similarly. Thus, our proposed Med-{pgQ}2 and {UQ}-{pgQ}2 methods perform slightly better for differential gene analysis of {RNA}-seq data skewed towards lowly expressed read counts with high variation by improving specificity while maintaining a good detection power with a control of the nominal {FDR} level.},

Human genetic population-based studies have identified numerous heritable sequence and structural genomic variants associated with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease. However, these germline variants do not fully account for disease risk. During brain development, progenitor cells undergo billions of cell divisions to generate the ∼80 billion neurons in the brain. The failure to accurately repair {DNA} damage arising during replication, transcription, and cellular metabolism amid this dramatic cellular expansion can lead to somatic mutations. Somatic mutations that alter subsets of neuronal transcriptomes and proteomes can, in turn, affect cell proliferation and survival and lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. The long life span of individual neurons and the direct relationship between neural circuits and behavior suggest that somatic mutations in small populations of neurons can significantly affect individual neurodevelopment. The Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network has been founded to study somatic mosaicism both in neurotypical human brains and in the context of complex neuropsychiatric disorders.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The prevalence of several human morbid phenotypes is sometimes much higher than intuitively expected. This can directly arise from the presence of two sexes, male and female, in one species. Men and women have almost identical genomes but are distinctly dimorphic, with dissimilar disease susceptibilities. Sexually dimorphic traits mainly result from differential expression of genes present in both sexes. Such genes can be subject to different, and even opposing, selection constraints in the two sexes. This can impact human evolution by differential selection on mutations with dissimilar effects on the two sexes. {RESULTS}: We comprehensively mapped human sex-differential genetic architecture across 53 tissues. Analyzing available {RNA}-sequencing data from 544 adults revealed thousands of genes differentially expressed in the reproductive tracts and tissues common to both sexes. Sex-differential genes are related to various biological systems, and suggest new insights into the pathophysiology of diverse human diseases. We also identified a significant association between sex-specific gene transcription and reduced selection efficiency and accumulation of deleterious mutations, which might affect the prevalence of different traits and diseases. Interestingly, many of the sex-specific genes that also undergo reduced selection efficiency are essential for successful reproduction in men or women. This seeming paradox might partially explain the high incidence of human infertility. {CONCLUSIONS}: This work provides a comprehensive overview of the sex-differential transcriptome and its importance to human evolution and human physiology in health and in disease.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) have identified a multitude of genetic loci involved with traits and diseases. However, it is often unclear which genes are affected in such loci and whether the associated genetic variants lead to increased or decreased gene function. To mitigate this, we integrated associations of common genetic variants in 57 {GWASs} with 24 studies of expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}) from a broad range of tissues by using a Mendelian randomization approach. We discovered a total of 3,484 instances of gene-trait-associated changes in expression at a false-discovery rate {\textbackslash}textless 0.05. These genes were often not closest to the genetic variant and were primarily identified in {eQTLs} derived from pathophysiologically relevant tissues. For instance, genes with expression changes associated with lipid traits were mostly identified in the liver, and those associated with cardiovascular disease were identified in arterial tissue. The affected genes additionally point to biological processes implicated in the interrogated traits, such as the interleukin-27 pathway in rheumatoid arthritis. Further, comparing trait-associated gene expression changes across traits suggests that pleiotropy is a widespread phenomenon and points to specific instances of both agonistic and antagonistic pleiotropy. For instance, expression of {SNX}19 and {ABCB}9 is positively correlated with both the risk of schizophrenia and educational attainment.

The biological role of the islands was also assessed, and pathogenicity, virulence and secondary metabolism pathways were functions highly represented, especially in islands that were found to be recently transferred. However, old islands are composed of a high proportion of genes related to cell primary metabolic functions.

In this study, we examined the association between genetic variations and gene expression in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, temporal cortex, thalamus and cerebellum in subjects with psychiatric disorders and in normal controls. We identified cis associations between 648 transcripts and 6725 {SNPs} in the various brain regions. Several {SNPs} showed brain regional-specific associations. The expression level of only one gene, {PDE}4DIP, was associated with a {SNP}, rs12124527, in all the brain regions tested here. From our data, we generated a list of brain cis expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) genes that we compared with a list of schizophrenia candidate genes downloaded from the Schizophrenia Forum ({SZgene}) database (http://www.szgene.org/). Of the {SZgene} candidate genes, we found that the expression levels of four genes, {HTR}2A, {PLXNA}2, {SRR} and {TCF}4, were significantly associated with cis {SNPs} in at least one brain region tested. One gene, {SRR}, was also involved in a coexpression module that we found to be associated with disease status. In addition, a substantial number of cis {eQTL} genes were also involved in the module, suggesting {eQTL} analysis of brain tissue may identify more reliable susceptibility genes for schizophrenia than case-control genetic association analyses.

	abstract = {{CACNA}1I is a candidate schizophrenia risk gene. It encodes the pore-forming human {CaV}3.3 {\textbackslash}alpha1 subunit, a subtype of voltage-gated calcium channel that contributes to T-type currents. Recently, two de novo missense variations, T797M and R1346H, of {hCaV}3.3 were identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Here we show that R1346H, but not T797M, is associated with lower {hCaV}3.3 protein levels, reduced glycosylation, and lower membrane surface levels of {hCaV}3.3 when expressed in human cell lines compared to wild-type. Consistent with our biochemical analyses, whole-cell {hCaV}3.3 currents in cells expressing the R1346H variant were ∼50\% of those in cells expressing {WT} {hCaV}3.3, and neither R1346H nor T797M altered channel biophysical properties. Employing the {NEURON} simulation environment, we found that reducing {hCaV}3.3 current densities by 22\% or more eliminates rebound bursting in model thalamic reticular nucleus ({TRN}) neurons. Our analyses suggest that a single copy of Chr22: 39665939G {\textbackslash}textgreater A {CACNA}1I has the capacity to disrupt {CaV}3.3 channel-dependent functions, including rebound bursting in {TRN} neurons, with potential implications for schizophrenia pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {T-type calcium channels (T/Ca(v)3-channels) are implicated in various physiologic and pathophysiologic processes such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, hypertension, and cancer. T-channels are the target of endogenous signaling lipids including the endocannabinoid anandamide, the ømega3-fatty acids, and the lipoamino-acids. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which these molecules inhibit T-current is unknown. In this study, we provided a detailed electrophysiologic and pharmacologic analysis indicating that the effects of the major N-acyl derivatives on the Ca(v)3.3 current share many similarities with those of {TTA}-A2 [(R)-2-(4-cyclopropylphenyl)-N-(1-(5-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)acetamide], a synthetic T-channel inhibitor. Using radioactive binding assays with the {TTA}-A2 derivative [(3)H]{TTA}-A1 [(R)-2-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(1-(5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)ethyl)acetamide], we demonstrated that polyunsaturated lipids, which inhibit the Ca(v)3.3 current, as {NAGly} (N-arachidonoyl glycine), {NASer} (N-arachidonoyl-l-serine), anandamide, {NADA} (N-arachidonoyl dopamine), {NATau} (N-arachidonoyl taurine), and {NA}-5HT (N-arachidonoyl serotonin), all displaced [(3)H]{TTA}-A1 binding to membranes prepared from cells expressing Ca(v)3.3, with Ki in a micromolar or submicromolar range. In contrast, lipids with a saturated alkyl chain, as N-arachidoyl glycine and N-arachidoyl ethanolamine, which did not inhibit the Ca(v)3.3 current, had no effect on [(3)H]{TTA}-A1 binding. Accordingly, bio-active lipids occluded {TTA}-A2 effect on Ca(v)3.3 current. In addition, {TTA}-Q4 [(S)-4-(6-chloro-4-cyclopropyl-3-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin-4-yl)benzonitrile], a positive allosteric modulator of [(3)H]{TTA}-A1 binding and {TTA}-A2 functional inhibition, acted in a synergistic manner to increase lipid-induced inhibition of the Ca(v)3.3 current. Overall, our results demonstrate a common molecular mechanism for the synthetic T-channel inhibitors and the endogenous lipids, and indicate that {TTA}-A2 and {TTA}-Q4 could be important pharmacologic tools to dissect the involvement of T-current in the physiologic effects of endogenous lipids.},

We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways.

Using {RNA}-seq data from molecular degradation experiments of human primary tissues, we introduce a method-quality surrogate variable analysis ({qSVA})-as a framework for estimating and removing the confounding effect of {RNA} quality in differential expression analysis. We show that this approach results in greatly improved replication rates ({\textbackslash}textgreater3×) across two large independent postmortem human brain studies of schizophrenia and also removes potential {RNA} quality biases in earlier published work that compared expression levels of different brain regions and other diagnostic groups.

	abstract = {We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates ({FDRs}), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to {FDR} analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This "unimodal assumption" ({UA}), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard {FDR} analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the {UA} facilitates efficient and robust computation-estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem-and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used ({\textbackslash}p{\textbackslash} value or {\textbackslash}z{\textbackslash} score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard {FDR} methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures, we introduce the term "local false sign rate" to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local {FDR} because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated.

In 22 patients treated with conventional dosages of classical neuroleptics, the D2 occupancy was 70\% to 89\%. Patients with acute extrapyramidal syndromes had a higher D2 occupancy than those without side effects. This finding indicates that neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes are related to the degree of central D2 occupancy induced in the basal ganglia. In five patients treated with clozapine, the prototype atypical antipsychotic drug, a lower D2 occupancy of 38\% to 63\% was found. This finding demonstrates that clozapine is also "atypical" with respect to the central D2 occupancy in patients. During treatment with clozapine, there is a low frequency of extrapyramidal syndromes, which accordingly may reflect the comparatively low D2 occupancy induced by clinical doses of clozapine. Classical neuroleptics, like haloperidol or sulpiride, did not cause any evident D1 occupancy, but the thioxanthene flupentixol induced a 36\% to 44\% occupancy. In four patients treated with clozapine, the D1 occupancy was 38\% to 52\%. The D1 occupancy induced by clozapine and flupentixol may contribute to the antipsychotic effect of these drugs.},

Findings from gene network analyses implicate immune networks as being enriched in {AD}; many of the genes in these networks fall within genomic regions that contain common and rare variants that are associated with increased risk of developing {AD}. Of these genes, several (including {CR}1, {SPI}1, the {MS}4As, {TREM}2, {ABCA}7, {CD}33, and {INPP}5D) are expressed by microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain.

While the incidence, symptoms and treatment of {MDD} all point toward major sex differences, the molecular mechanisms underlying this sexual dimorphism remain largely unknown. Here, combining differential expression and gene coexpression network analyses, we provide a comprehensive characterization of male and female transcriptional profiles associated with {MDD} across six brain regions. We overlap our human profiles with those from a mouse model, chronic variable stress, and capitalize on converging pathways to define molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the expression of stress susceptibility in males and females. Our results show a major rearrangement of transcriptional patterns in {MDD}, with limited overlap between males and females, an effect seen in both depressed humans and stressed mice. We identify key regulators of sex-specific gene networks underlying {MDD} and confirm their sex-specific impact as mediators of stress susceptibility. For example, downregulation of the female-specific hub gene Dusp6 in mouse prefrontal cortex mimicked stress susceptibility in females, but not males, by increasing {ERK} signaling and pyramidal neuron excitability. Such Dusp6 downregulation also recapitulated the transcriptional remodeling that occurs in prefrontal cortex of depressed females. Together our findings reveal marked sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional level in {MDD} and highlight the importance of studying sex-specific treatments for this disorder.},

	abstract = {In many microarray studies, a cluster defined on one dataset is sought in an independent dataset. If the cluster is found in the new dataset, the cluster is said to be "reproducible" and may be biologically significant. Classifying a new datum to a previously defined cluster can be seen as predicting which of the previously defined clusters is most similar to the new datum. If the new data classified to a cluster are similar, molecularly or clinically, to the data already present in the cluster, then the cluster is reproducible and the corresponding prediction accuracy is high. Here, we take advantage of the connection between reproducibility and prediction accuracy to develop a validation procedure for clusters found in datasets independent of the one in which they were characterized. We define a cluster quality measure called the "in-group proportion" ({IGP}) and introduce a general procedure for individually validating clusters. Using simulations and real breast cancer datasets, the {IGP} is compared to four other popular cluster quality measures (homogeneity score, separation score, silhouette width, and weighted average discrepant pairs score). Moreover, simulations and the real breast cancer datasets are used to compare the four versions of the validation procedure which all use the {IGP}, but differ in the way in which the null distributions are generated. We find that the {IGP} is the best measure of prediction accuracy, and one version of the validation procedure is the more widely applicable than the other three. An implementation of this algorithm is in a package called "{clusterRepro}" available through The Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.r-project.org).},

	abstract = {The loss of midbrain dopamine in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by a matching loss in the dopamine transporter and a rise in the D1 and D2 receptor densities. This is found in the brain putamen and caudate tissues from unmedicated patients, and may account for the good early clinical response to L-dopa. Long-term L-dopa treatment reverts the receptor densities toward normal levels. Positron emission tomography ({PET}) data and in vitro data generally concur. In schizophrenia the density of the dopamine transporter as well as that of the D1 dopamine receptor is normal. The D2 receptor density, however, is consistently elevated in postmortem brain putamen and caudate nucleus, even in tissues from neuroleptic-free or drug-naive patients. Three sets of {PET} and single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}) data support the postmortem findings. Early evidence indicating abnormal D2 structure as well as a reduced link between D1 and D2 warrant a detailed study of the genes for these two receptors in schizophrenia.},

Recent findings from several large genetic studies suggest a large number of risk variants are involved (i.e. schizophrenia is a polygenic disorder) and analytic approaches could be tailored for this scenario. Novel statistical approaches for analyzing {GWAS} data have recently been developed to be more sensitive to polygenic traits. These approaches have provided intriguing new insights into neurobiological pathways and support for the involvement of regulatory mechanisms, neurotransmission (glutamate, dopamine, {GABA}), and immune and neurodevelopmental pathways. Integrating the emerging statistical genetics evidence with sound neurobiological experiments will be a crucial, and challenging, next step in deciphering the specific disease mechanisms of schizophrenia.

	abstract = {Methods for multiple-testing correction in local expression quantitative trait locus (cis-{eQTL}) studies are a trade-off between statistical power and computational efficiency. Bonferroni correction, though computationally trivial, is overly conservative and fails to account for linkage disequilibrium between variants. Permutation-based methods are more powerful, though computationally far more intensive. We present an alternative correction method called {eigenMT}, which runs over 500 times faster than permutations and has adjusted p values that closely approximate empirical ones. To achieve this speed while also maintaining the accuracy of permutation-based methods, we estimate the effective number of independent variants tested for association with a particular gene, termed Meff, by using the eigenvalue decomposition of the genotype correlation matrix. We employ a regularized estimator of the correlation matrix to ensure Meff is robust and yields adjusted p values that closely approximate p values from permutations. Finally, using a common genotype matrix, we show that {eigenMT} can be applied with even greater efficiency to studies across tissues or conditions. Our method provides a simpler, more efficient approach to multiple-testing correction than existing methods and fits within existing pipelines for {eQTL} discovery.

	abstract = {The X Chromosome, with its unique mode of inheritance, contributes to differences between the sexes at a molecular level, including sex-specific gene expression and sex-specific impact of genetic variation. Improving our understanding of these differences offers to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying sex-specific traits and diseases. However, to date, most studies have either ignored the X Chromosome or had insufficient power to test for the sex-specific impact of genetic variation. By analyzing whole blood transcriptomes of 922 individuals, we have conducted the first large-scale, genome-wide analysis of the impact of both sex and genetic variation on patterns of gene expression, including comparison between the X Chromosome and autosomes. We identified a depletion of expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) on the X Chromosome, especially among genes under high selective constraint. In contrast, we discovered an enrichment of sex-specific regulatory variants on the X Chromosome. To resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects, we generated chromatin accessibility data through {ATAC}-sequencing to connect sex-specific chromatin accessibility to sex-specific patterns of expression and regulatory variation. As sex-specific regulatory variants discovered in our study can inform sex differences in heritable disease prevalence, we integrated our data with genome-wide association study data for multiple immune traits identifying several traits with significant sex biases in genetic susceptibilities. Together, our study provides genome-wide insight into how genetic variation, the X Chromosome, and sex shape human gene regulation and disease. {\textbackslash}copyright 2016 Kukurba et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: It has been shown that gene expression in human tissues is heritable, thus predicting gene expression using only {SNPs} becomes possible. The prediction of gene expression can offer important implications on the genetic architecture of individual functional associated {SNPs} and further interpretations of the molecular basis underlying human diseases. {METHODS}: We compared three types of methods for predicting gene expression using only cis-{SNPs}, including the polygenic model, i.e. linear mixed model ({LMM}), two sparse models, i.e. Lasso and elastic net ({ENET}), and the hybrid of {LMM} and sparse model, i.e. Bayesian sparse linear mixed model ({BSLMM}). The three kinds of prediction methods have very different assumptions of underlying genetic architectures. These methods were evaluated using simulations under various scenarios, and were applied to the Geuvadis gene expression data. {RESULTS}: The simulations showed that these four prediction methods (i.e. Lasso, {ENET}, {LMM} and {BSLMM}) behaved best when their respective modeling assumptions were satisfied, but {BSLMM} had a robust performance across a range of scenarios. According to R 2 of these models in the Geuvadis data, the four methods performed quite similarly. We did not observe any clustering or enrichment of predictive genes (defined as genes with R 2 ≥ 0.05) across the chromosomes, and also did not see there was any clear relationship between the proportion of the predictive genes and the proportion of genes in each chromosome. However, an interesting finding in the Geuvadis data was that highly predictive genes (e.g. R 2 ≥ 0.30) may have sparse genetic architectures since Lasso, {ENET} and {BSLMM} outperformed {LMM} for these genes; and this observation was validated in another gene expression data. We further showed that the predictive genes were enriched in approximately independent {LD} blocks. {CONCLUSIONS}: Gene expression can be predicted with only cis-{SNPs} using well-developed prediction models and these predictive genes were enriched in some approximately independent {LD} blocks. The prediction of gene expression can shed some light on the functional interpretation for identified {SNPs} in {GWASs}.},

Type {II} cells are spherical pneumocytes which comprise only 4\% of the alveolar surface area, yet they constitute 60\% of alveolar epithelial cells and 10-15\% of all lung cells. Four major functions have been attributed to alveolar type {II} cells: (1) synthesis and secretion of surfactant; (2) xenobiotic metabolism; (3) transepithelial movement of water; and (4) regeneration of the alveolar epithelium following lung injury. Therefore, alveolar type {II} cells play important roles in normal pulmonary function and in the response of the lung to toxic compounds which may cause lung damage. Techniques have now been developed to isolate and purify alveolar type {II} epithelial cells from lung tissue. Such cellular preparations afford bioassay systems to monitor the effects of occupational or environmental pollutants on alveolar pneumocytes and should yield important information concerning the etiology of pulmonary disease in the alveolar region of the lung.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) risk loci fall in non-coding regions of the genome. One possible hypothesis is that these {GWAS} risk loci alter the individual's disease risk through their effect on gene expression in different tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving a {GWAS} risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is affected in specific tissue types. For example, the relevant gene and tissue could play a role in the disease mechanism if the same variant responsible for a {GWAS} locus also affects gene expression. Identifying whether or not the same variant is causal in both {GWASs} and expression quantitative trail locus ({eQTL}) studies is challenging because of the uncertainty induced by linkage disequilibrium and the fact that some loci harbor multiple causal variants. However, current methods that address this problem assume that each locus contains a single causal variant. In this paper, we present {eCAVIAR}, a probabilistic method that has several key advantages over existing methods. First, our method can account for more than one causal variant in any given locus. Second, it can leverage summary statistics without accessing the individual genotype data. We use both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the utility of our method. Using publicly available {eQTL} data on 45 different tissues, we demonstrate that {eCAVIAR} can prioritize likely relevant tissues and target genes for a set of glucose- and insulin-related trait loci.

However, the existing methods often lack rigor and/or computational efficiency and consequently do not maximize the utility of functional annotations. In this paper, we propose a rigorous inference procedure to perform integrative association analysis incorporating genomic annotations for both traditional {GWASs} and emerging molecular {QTL} mapping studies. In particular, we propose an algorithm, named deterministic approximation of posteriors ({DAP}), which enables highly efficient and accurate joint enrichment analysis and identification of multiple causal variants. We use a series of simulation studies to highlight the power and computational efficiency of our proposed approach and further demonstrate it by analyzing the cross-population {eQTL} data from the {GEUVADIS} project and the multi-tissue {eQTL} data from the {GTEx} project. In particular, we find that genetic variants predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding sites are enriched in cis-{eQTLs} across all tissues. Moreover, the enrichment estimates obtained across the tissues are correlated with the cell types for which the annotations are derived.

	abstract = {Although genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of risk loci for complex traits, only a handful of the biologically causal variants, responsible for association at these loci, have been successfully identified. Current statistical methods for identifying causal variants at risk loci either use the strength of the association signal in an iterative conditioning framework or estimate probabilities for variants to be causal. A main drawback of existing methods is that they rely on the simplifying assumption of a single causal variant at each risk locus, which is typically invalid at many risk loci. In this work, we propose a new statistical framework that allows for the possibility of an arbitrary number of causal variants when estimating the posterior probability of a variant being causal. A direct benefit of our approach is that we predict a set of variants for each locus that under reasonable assumptions will contain all of the true causal variants with a high confidence level (e.g., 95\%) even when the locus contains multiple causal variants. We use simulations to show that our approach provides 20-50\% improvement in our ability to identify the causal variants compared to the existing methods at loci harboring multiple causal variants. We validate our approach using empirical data from an expression {QTL} study of {CHI}3L2 to identify new causal variants that affect gene expression at this locus. {CAVIAR} is publicly available online at http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/caviar/.

The extent to which {XCI} is shared between cells and tissues remains poorly characterized, as does the degree to which incomplete {XCI} manifests as detectable sex differences in gene expression and phenotypic traits. Here we describe a systematic survey of {XCI}, integrating over 5,500 transcriptomes from 449 individuals spanning 29 tissues from {GTEx} (v6p release) and 940 single-cell transcriptomes, combined with genomic sequence data. We show that {XCI} at 683 X-chromosomal genes is generally uniform across human tissues, but identify examples of heterogeneity between tissues, individuals and cells. We show that incomplete {XCI} affects at least 23\% of X-chromosomal genes, identify seven genes that escape {XCI} with support from multiple lines of evidence and demonstrate that escape from {XCI} results in sex biases in gene expression, establishing incomplete {XCI} as a mechanism that is likely to introduce phenotypic diversity. Overall, this updated catalogue of {XCI} across human tissues helps to increase our understanding of the extent and impact of the incompleteness in the maintenance of {XCI}.},

The Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.},

We determined that {SNPs} with low {LLD} have significantly larger per-{SNP} heritability and that roughly half of this effect can be explained by functional annotations negatively correlated with {LLD}, such as {DNase} I hypersensitivity sites ({DHSs}). The remaining signal is largely driven by our finding that more recent common variants tend to have lower {LLD} and to explain more heritability (P = 2.38 × 10-104); the youngest 20\% of common {SNPs} explain 3.9 times more heritability than the oldest 20\%, consistent with the action of negative selection.

This Review revisits the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia from a current genetics perspective, delineating the complex genetic basis of the disorder and highlighting gene expression and epigenetic analyses of post-mortem cortical tissue that suggest that early brain development mediates genetic risk associated with schizophrenia.

There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that complex interactions are 'the norm' and, rather than amounting to a small perturbation to classical Mendelian genetics, interactions may be the predominant effect. Traditional statistical methods are not well suited for detecting such interactions, especially when the data are high dimensional (many attributes or independent variables) or when interactions occur between more than two polymorphisms. In this review, we discuss machine-learning models and algorithms for identifying and characterising susceptibility genes in common, complex, multifactorial human diseases. We focus on the following machine-learning methods that have been used to detect gene-gene interactions: neural networks, cellular automata, random forests, and multifactor dimensionality reduction. We conclude with some ideas about how these methods and others can be integrated into a comprehensive and flexible framework for data mining and knowledge discovery in human genetics.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with unclear etiology and imprecise genetic causes. The main goal of this work was to investigate neuronal connectivity and the interplay between neurons and astrocytes from individuals with nonsyndromic {ASD} using induced pluripotent stem cells. {METHODS}: Induced pluripotent stem cells were derived from a clinically well-characterized cohort of three individuals with nonsyndromic {ASD} sharing common behaviors and three control subjects, two clones each. We generated mixed neural cultures analyzing synaptogenesis and neuronal activity using a multielectrode array platform. Furthermore, using an enriched astrocyte population, we investigated their role in neuronal maintenance. {RESULTS}: {ASD}-derived neurons had a significant decrease in synaptic gene expression and protein levels, glutamate neurotransmitter release, and, consequently, reduced spontaneous firing rate. Based on co-culture experiments, we observed that {ASD}-derived astrocytes interfered with proper neuronal development. In contrast, control-derived astrocytes rescued the morphological neuronal phenotype and synaptogenesis defects from {ASD} neuronal co-cultures. Furthermore, after identifying interleukin-6 secretion from astrocytes in individuals with {ASD} as a possible culprit for neural defects, we were able to increase synaptogenesis by blocking interleukin-6 levels. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings reveal the contribution of astrocytes to neuronal phenotype and confirm previous studies linking interleukin-6 and autism, suggesting potential novel therapeutic pathways for a subtype of individuals with {ASD}. This is the first report demonstrating that glial dysfunctions could contribute to nonsyndromic autism pathophysiology using induced pluripotent stem cells modeling disease technology.

With the increasing availability of genome-wide association study summary statistics, as well as the establishment of deeply phenotyped sample collections, it is now possible to systematically assess the genetic overlap between multiple traits and diseases. In addition to increasing power to detect associated variants, multi-trait methods can also aid our understanding of how different disorders are aetiologically linked by highlighting relevant biological pathways. A plethora of available tools to perform such analyses exists, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this review, we outline some of the currently available methods to conduct multi-trait analyses. First, we briefly introduce the concept of pleiotropy and outline the current landscape of pleiotropy research in human genetics; second, we describe analytical considerations and analysis methods; finally, we discuss future directions for the field. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Inference about the causal structure that induces correlations between two traits can be achieved by combining genetic associations with a mediation-based approach, as is done in the causal inference test ({CIT}). However, we show that measurement error in the phenotypes can lead to the {CIT} inferring the wrong causal direction, and that increasing sample sizes has the adverse effect of increasing confidence in the wrong answer. This problem is likely to be general to other mediation-based approaches. Here we introduce an extension to Mendelian randomisation, a method that uses genetic associations in an instrumentation framework, that enables inference of the causal direction between traits, with some advantages. First, it can be performed using only summary level data from genome-wide association studies; second, it is less susceptible to bias in the presence of measurement error or unmeasured confounding. We apply the method to infer the causal direction between {DNA} methylation and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate that, in general, {DNA} methylation is more likely to be the causal factor, but this result is highly susceptible to bias induced by systematic differences in measurement error between the platforms, and by horizontal pleiotropy. We emphasise that, where possible, implementing {MR} and appropriate sensitivity analyses alongside other approaches such as {CIT} is important to triangulate reliable conclusions about causality.},

	abstract = {Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such as {RNA}-Sequencing ({RNA}-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell {RNA}-Seq ({scRNA}-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, {RNA}-seq and {scRNA}-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike {RNA}-seq, the majority of reported expression levels in {scRNA}-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing {RNA} at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing {RNA}, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to {RNA}-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on {scRNA}-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that {scRNA}-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Stroke is an important cause of death among blacks, and intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages account for nearly half of all early deaths from stroke. The present study investigates whether blacks and whites differ in their risk of having either intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage. {METHODS}: We reviewed the medical records, autopsy reports, and {CT} scans of all patients suspected of having had an intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage during 1988 among the nearly 1.3 million people in the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan area. {RESULTS}: There were 221 cases of first spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage among 1,086,462 whites (159 intracerebral and 62 subarachnoid hemorrhages), and 45 cases among 171,718 blacks (27 intracerebral and 18 subarachnoid hemorrhages). Blacks had 2.1 times the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage of whites (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 3.6) and 1.4 times the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 2.1). In those under the age of 75, the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage among blacks was 2.3 times that of whites (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.6), whereas the risk among blacks 75 or older was one fourth that of whites (95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.8). Deaths within 30 days of intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage accounted for 1.9 years of life lost per 1000 blacks under 65 years of age, as compared with 0.5 year per 1000 whites. {CONCLUSIONS}: Young and middle-aged blacks have a substantially higher risk of subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage than whites of similar age. These types of stroke are important causes of excess mortality among young and middle-aged blacks.},

	abstract = {The most recent genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) of schizophrenia ({SCZ}) identified hundreds of risk variants potentially implicated in the disease. Further, novel statistical methodology designed for polygenic architecture revealed more potential risk variants. This can provide a link between individual genetic factors and the mechanistic underpinnings of {SCZ}. Intriguingly, a large number of genes coding for ionotropic and metabotropic receptors for various neurotransmitters-glutamate, {\textbackslash}gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}), dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and opioids-and numerous ion channels were associated with {SCZ}. Here, we review these findings from the standpoint of classical neurobiological knowledge of neuronal synaptic transmission and regulation of electrical excitability. We show that a substantial proportion of the identified genes are involved in intracellular cascades known to integrate 'slow' (G-protein-coupled receptors) and 'fast' (ionotropic receptors) neurotransmission converging on the protein {DARPP}-32. Inspection of the Human Brain Transcriptome Project database confirms that that these genes are indeed expressed in the brain, with the expression profile following specific developmental trajectories, underscoring their relevance to brain organization and function. These findings extend the existing pathophysiology hypothesis by suggesting a unifying role of dysregulation in neuronal excitability and synaptic integration in {SCZ}. This emergent model supports the concept of {SCZ} as an 'associative' disorder-a breakdown in the communication across different slow and fast neurotransmitter systems through intracellular signaling pathways-and may unify a number of currently competing hypotheses of {SCZ} pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Methods for genetic risk prediction have been widely investigated in recent years. However, most available training data involves European samples, and it is currently unclear how to accurately predict disease risk in other populations. Previous studies have used either training data from European samples in large sample size or training data from the target population in small sample size, but not both. Here, we introduce a multiethnic polygenic risk score that combines training data from European samples and training data from the target population. We applied this approach to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a Latino cohort using both publicly available European summary statistics in large sample size (Neff = 40k) and Latino training data in small sample size (Neff = 8k). Here, we attained a {\textbackslash}textgreater70\% relative improvement in prediction accuracy (from R2 = 0.027 to 0.047) compared to methods that use only one source of training data, consistent with large relative improvements in simulations. We observed a systematically lower load of T2D risk alleles in Latino individuals with more European ancestry, which could be explained by polygenic selection in ancestral European and/or Native American populations. We predict T2D in a South Asian {UK} Biobank cohort using European (Neff = 40k) and South Asian (Neff = 16k) training data and attained a {\textbackslash}textgreater70\% relative improvement in prediction accuracy, and application to predict height in an African {UK} Biobank cohort using European (N = 113k) and African (N = 2k) training data attained a 30\% relative improvement. Our work reduces the gap in polygenic risk prediction accuracy between European and non-European target populations. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 {WILEY} {PERIODICALS}, {INC}.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Analysis of next-generation sequencing data often results in a list of genomic regions. These may include differentially methylated {CpGs}/regions, transcription factor binding sites, interacting chromatin regions, or {GWAS}-associated {SNPs}, among others. A common analysis step is to annotate such genomic regions to genomic annotations (promoters, exons, enhancers, etc.). Existing tools are limited by a lack of annotation sources and flexible options, the time it takes to annotate regions, an artificial one-to-one region-to-annotation mapping, a lack of visualization options to easily summarize data, or some combination thereof. {RESULTS}: We developed the annotatr Bioconductor package to flexibly and quickly summarize and plot annotations of genomic regions. The annotatr package reports all intersections of regions and annotations, giving a better understanding of the genomic context of the regions. A variety of graphics functions are implemented to easily plot numerical or categorical data associated with the regions across the annotations, and across annotation intersections, providing insight into how characteristics of the regions differ across the annotations. We demonstrate that annotatr is up to 27× faster than comparable R packages.

High-throughput transcriptome sequencing ({RNA}-Seq) has become the main option for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential expression analysis from {RNA}-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for identifying differentially expressed genes from {RNA}-Seq data. This work presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and nine methods of differential expression analysis from {RNA}-Seq data. The adopted methods were evaluated based on real {RNA}-Seq data, using {qRT}-{PCR} data as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final {DEGs} analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome. Regarding the adopted experimental model, the {DEGs} identification methods that have more consistent results were the limma+voom, {NOIseq} and {DESeq}2. Additionally, the consensus among five {DEGs} identification methods guarantees a list of {DEGs} with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of different methods can produce more suitable results.

	abstract = {Evidence suggests many neurological disorders emerge when normal neurodevelopmental trajectories are disrupted, i.e., when circuits or cells do not reach their fully mature state. Microglia play a critical role in normal neurodevelopment and are hypothesized to contribute to brain disease. We used whole transcriptome profiling with Next Generation sequencing of purified developing microglia to identify a microglial developmental gene expression program involving thousands of genes whose expression levels change monotonically (up or down) across development. Importantly, the gene expression program was delayed in males relative to females and exposure of adult male mice to {LPS}, a potent immune activator, accelerated microglial development in males. Next, a microglial developmental index ({MDI}) generated from gene expression patterns obtained from purified mouse microglia, was applied to human brain transcriptome datasets to test the hypothesis that variability in microglial development is associated with human diseases such as Alzheimer's and autism where microglia have been suggested to play a role. {MDI} was significantly increased in both Alzheimer's Disease and in autism, suggesting that accelerated microglial development may contribute to neuropathology. In conclusion, we identified a microglia-specific gene expression program in mice that was used to create a microglia developmental index, which was applied to human datasets containing heterogeneous cell types to reveal differences between healthy and diseased brain samples, and between males and females. This powerful tool has wide ranging applicability to examine microglial development within the context of disease and in response to other variables such as stress and pharmacological treatments. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Because of the compartmentalization of disciplines that shaped the academic landscape of biology and biomedical sciences in the past, physiological systems have long been studied in isolation from each other. This has particularly been the case for the immune system. As a consequence of its ties with pathology and microbiology, immunology as a discipline has largely grown independently of physiology. Accordingly, it has taken a long time for immunologists to accept the concept that the immune system is not self-regulated but functions in close association with the nervous system. These associations are present at different levels of organization. At the local level, there is clear evidence for the production and use of immune factors by the central nervous system and for the production and use of neuroendocrine mediators by the immune system. Short-range interactions between immune cells and peripheral nerve endings innervating immune organs allow the immune system to recruit local neuronal elements for fine tuning of the immune response. Reciprocally, immune cells and mediators play a regulatory role in the nervous system and participate in the elimination and plasticity of synapses during development as well as in synaptic plasticity at adulthood. At the whole organism level, long-range interactions between immune cells and the central nervous system allow the immune system to engage the rest of the body in the fight against infection from pathogenic microorganisms and permit the nervous system to regulate immune functioning. Alterations in communication pathways between the immune system and the nervous system can account for many pathological conditions that were initially attributed to strict organ dysfunction. This applies in particular to psychiatric disorders and several immune-mediated diseases. This review will show how our understanding of this balance between long-range and short-range interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system has evolved over time, since the first demonstrations of immune influences on brain functions. The necessary complementarity of these two modes of communication will then be discussed. Finally, a few examples will illustrate how dysfunction in these communication pathways results in what was formerly considered in psychiatry and immunology to be strict organ pathologies.},

The consequences of somatic mosaicism span vast dimensions -from a single-locus variant, to genes and gene networks, to cells, to the interactions of the mosaic cells via neural networks affecting behavior and cognition.

We provide national estimates of stroke incidence by race and region, contrasting these to publicly available stroke mortality data. {METHODS}: This analysis included 27,744 men and women without prevalent stroke (40.4\% black), aged ≥45 years from the {REasons} for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ({REGARDS}) national cohort study, enrolled 2003-2007. Incident stroke was defined as first occurrence of stroke over 4.4 years of follow-up. Age-sex-adjusted stroke mortality rates were calculated using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC}) Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiological Research ({WONDER}) System. {RESULTS}: There were 460 incident strokes over 113,469 person-years of follow-up. Relative to the rest of the United States, incidence rate ratios ({IRRs}) of stroke in the southeastern stroke belt and stroke buckle were 1.06 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.87-1.29) and 1.19 (95\% {CI}, 0.96-1.47), respectively. The age-sex-adjusted black/white {IRR}(black) was 1.51 (95\% {CI}, 1.26-1.81), but for ages 45-54 years the {IRR}(black) was 4.02 (95\% {CI}, 1.23-13.11) while for ages 85+ it was 0.86 (95\% {CI}, 0.33-2.20). Generally, the {IRRs}(black) were less than the mortality rate ratios ({MRRs}) across age groups; however, only in ages 55-64 years and 65-74 years did the 95\% {CIs} of {IRRs}(black) not include the {MRR}(black) . The {MRRs} for regions were within 95\% {CIs} for {IRRs}. {INTERPRETATION}: National patterns of black-white and regional differences in stroke incidence are similar to those for stroke mortality; however, the magnitude of differences in incidence appear smaller.

	abstract = {The predisposition to neuropsychiatric disease involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. However, little is known about how genetic variants impart brain dysfunction or pathology. We used transcriptomic profiling as a quantitative readout of molecular brain-based phenotypes across five major psychiatric disorders-autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and alcoholism-compared with matched controls. We identified patterns of shared and distinct gene-expression perturbations across these conditions. The degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation is related to polygenic (single-nucleotide polymorphism-based) overlap across disorders, suggesting a substantial causal genetic component. This comprehensive systems-level view of the neurobiological architecture of major neuropsychiatric illness demonstrates pathways of molecular convergence and specificity.

	abstract = {Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}) will significantly improve patient care. Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict {HCC} survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill this gap, we present a deep learning ({DL})-based model on {HCC} that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We built the {DL}-based, survival-sensitive model on 360 {HCC} patients' data using {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-Seq), {miRNA} sequencing ({miRNA}-Seq), and methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}), which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This {DL}-based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (P = 7.13e-6) and good model fitness [concordance index (C-index) = 0.68]. More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent {TP}53 inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers ({KRT}19 and {EPCAM}) and tumor marker {BIRC}5, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: {LIRI}-{JP} cohort (n = 230, C-index = 0.75), {NCI} cohort (n = 221, C-index = 0.67), Chinese cohort (n = 166, C-index = 0.69), E-{TABM}-36 cohort (n = 40, C-index = 0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n = 27, C-index = 0.82). This is the first study to employ {DL} to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of patients with {HCC}. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we expect this workflow to be useful at predicting {HCC} prognosis prediction.

We found that smoking, together with age, sex and latent infection with cytomegalovirus, were the main non-genetic factors that affected variation in parameters of human immune cells. Genome-wide association studies of 166 immunophenotypes identified 15 loci that showed enrichment for disease-associated variants. Finally, we demonstrated that the parameters of innate cells were more strongly controlled by genetic variation than were those of adaptive cells, which were driven by mainly environmental exposure. Our data establish a resource that will generate new hypotheses in immunology and highlight the role of innate immunity in susceptibility to common autoimmune diseases.},

Spatiotemporal and cell type-specific analyses of the transcriptome, the sum total of all {RNA} transcripts in a cell or an organ, can provide insights into the role of genes in brain development and function, and their potential contribution to disorders of the brain. In the previous decade, advances in sequencing technology and funding from the National Institutes of Health and private foundations for large-scale genomics projects have led to a growing collection of brain transcriptome databases. These valuable resources provide rich and high-quality datasets with spatiotemporal, cell type-specific, and single-cell precision. Most importantly, many of these databases are publicly available via user-friendly web interface, making the information accessible to individual scientists without the need for advanced computational expertise. Here, we highlight key publicly available brain transcriptome databases, summarize the tissue sources and methods used to generate the data, and discuss their utility for neuroscience research.

	abstract = {The mammalian prefrontal cortex comprises a set of highly specialized brain areas containing billions of cells and serves as the centre of the highest-order cognitive functions, such as memory, cognitive ability, decision-making and social behaviour. Although neural circuits are formed in the late stages of human embryonic development and even after birth, diverse classes of functional cells are generated and migrate to the appropriate locations earlier in development. Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex contributes to cognitive deficits and the majority of neurodevelopmental disorders; there is therefore a need for detailed knowledge of the development of the prefrontal cortex. However, it is still difficult to identify cell types in the developing human prefrontal cortex and to distinguish their developmental features. Here we analyse more than 2,300 single cells in the developing human prefrontal cortex from gestational weeks 8 to 26 using {RNA} sequencing. We identify 35 subtypes of cells in six main classes and trace the developmental trajectories of these cells. Detailed analysis of neural progenitor cells highlights new marker genes and unique developmental features of intermediate progenitor cells. We also map the timeline of neurogenesis of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex and detect the presence of interneuron progenitors in early developing prefrontal cortex. Moreover, we reveal the intrinsic development-dependent signals that regulate neuron generation and circuit formation using single-cell transcriptomic data analysis. Our screening and characterization approach provides a blueprint for understanding the development of the human prefrontal cortex in the early and mid-gestational stages in order to systematically dissect the cellular basis and molecular regulation of prefrontal cortex function in humans.},

These new insights have revolutionized our approach to resolve the genetic variation underlying complex diseases. Gene transcript levels were the first expression phenotypes that were studied. They are heritable and therefore amenable to genome-wide association studies. The genetic variants that modulate them are called expression quantitative trait loci. Their study has been extended to other molecular quantitative trait loci ({molQTLs}) that regulate gene expression at the various levels, from chromatin state to cellular responses. Altogether, these studies have generated a wealth of basic information on the genome-wide patterns of gene expression and their inter-individual variation. Most importantly, {molQTLs} have become an invaluable asset in the genetic study of complex diseases. Although the identification of the disease-causing variants on the basis of their overlap with {molQTLs} requires caution, {molQTLs} can help to prioritize the relevant candidate gene(s) in the disease-associated regions and bring a functional interpretation of the associated variants, therefore, bridging the gap between genotypes and clinical phenotypes. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.

Using multiple droplet-based {scRNA}-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our {MNN} batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

A formula is proposed to estimate the sample size required to detect an interaction between two binary variables in a factorial design with repeated measures of a continuous outcome. The formula is based, in part, on the fact that the variance of an interaction is fourfold that of the main effect. A simulation study examines the statistical power associated with the resulting sample sizes in a mixed-effects linear regression model with a random intercept. The simulation varies the magnitude ({\textbackslash}Delta) of the standardized main effects and interactions, the intraclass correlation coefficient ({\textbackslash}rho ), and the number (k) of repeated measures within-subject.

	abstract = {{DNA} sequence variation causes changes in gene expression, which in turn has profound effects on cellular states. These variations affect tissue development and may ultimately lead to pathological phenotypes. A genetic locus containing a sequence variation that affects gene expression is called an "expression quantitative trait locus" ({eQTL}). Whereas the impact of cellular context on expression levels in general is well established, a lot less is known about the cell-state specificity of {eQTL}. Previous studies differed with respect to how "dynamic {eQTL}" were defined. Here, we propose a unified framework distinguishing static, conditional and dynamic {eQTL} and suggest strategies for mapping these {eQTL} classes. Further, we introduce a new approach to simultaneously infer {eQTL} from different cell types. By using murine {mRNA} expression data from four stages of hematopoiesis and 14 related cellular traits, we demonstrate that static, conditional and dynamic {eQTL}, although derived from the same expression data, represent functionally distinct types of {eQTL}. While static {eQTL} affect generic cellular processes, non-static {eQTL} are more often involved in hematopoiesis and immune response. Our analysis revealed substantial effects of individual genetic variation on cell type-specific expression regulation. Among a total number of 3,941 {eQTL} we detected 2,729 static {eQTL}, 1,187 {eQTL} were conditionally active in one or several cell types, and 70 {eQTL} affected expression changes during cell type transitions. We also found evidence for feedback control mechanisms reverting the effect of an {eQTL} specifically in certain cell types. Loci correlated with hematological traits were enriched for conditional {eQTL}, thus, demonstrating the importance of conditional {eQTL} for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying physiological trait variation. The classification proposed here has the potential to streamline and unify future analysis of conditional and dynamic {eQTL} as well as many other kinds of {QTL} data.},

	abstract = {Microarray studies yield data sets consisting of a large number of candidate predictors (genes) on a small number of observations (samples). When interest lies in predicting phenotypic class using gene expression data, often the goals are both to produce an accurate classifier and to uncover the predictive structure of the problem. Most machine learning methods, such as kk-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, are useful for classification. However, these methods provide no insight regarding the covariates that best contribute to the predictive structure. Other methods, such as linear discriminant analysis, require the predictor space be substantially reduced prior to deriving the classifier. A recently developed method, random forests ({RF}), does not require reduction of the predictor space prior to classification. Additionally, {RF} yield variable importance measures for each candidate predictor. This study examined the effectiveness of {RF} variable importance measures in identifying the true predictor among a large number of candidate predictors. An extensive simulation study was conducted using 20 levels of correlation among the predictor variables and 7 levels of association between the true predictor and the dichotomous response. We conclude that the {RF} methodology is attractive for use in classification problems when the goals of the study are to produce an accurate classifier and to provide insight regarding the discriminative ability of individual predictor variables. Such goals are common among microarray studies, and therefore application of the {RF} methodology for the purpose of obtaining variable importance measures is demonstrated on a microarray data set.},

By applying knowledge of the cellular taxonomy of the brain from single-cell {RNA} sequencing, we evaluated whether the genomic loci implicated in schizophrenia map onto specific brain cell types. We found that the common-variant genomic results consistently mapped to pyramidal cells, medium spiny neurons ({MSNs}) and certain interneurons, but far less consistently to embryonic, progenitor or glial cells. These enrichments were due to sets of genes that were specifically expressed in each of these cell types. We also found that many of the diverse gene sets previously associated with schizophrenia (genes involved in synaptic function, those encoding {mRNAs} that interact with {FMRP}, antipsychotic targets, etc.) generally implicated the same brain cell types. Our results suggest a parsimonious explanation: the common-variant genetic results for schizophrenia point at a limited set of neurons, and the gene sets point to the same cells. The genetic risk associated with {MSNs} did not overlap with that of glutamatergic pyramidal cells and interneurons, suggesting that different cell types have biologically distinct roles in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in sequencing technology, it is now feasible to measure {DNA} methylation at tens of millions of sites across the entire genome. In most applications, biologists are interested in detecting differentially methylated regions, composed of multiple sites with differing methylation levels among populations. However, current computational approaches for detecting such regions do not provide accurate statistical inference. A major challenge in reporting uncertainty is that a genome-wide scan is involved in detecting these regions, which needs to be accounted for. A further challenge is that sample sizes are limited due to the costs associated with the technology. We have developed a new approach that overcomes these challenges and assesses uncertainty for differentially methylated regions in a rigorous manner. Region-level statistics are obtained by fitting a generalized least squares regression model with a nested autoregressive correlated error structure for the effect of interest on transformed methylation proportions. We develop an inferential approach, based on a pooled null distribution, that can be implemented even when as few as two samples per population are available. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of our method using both experimental data and Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the new method improves the specificity and sensitivity of lists of regions and accurately controls the false discovery rate. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2018.

On the other hand, schizophrenia is highly heritable with a pattern consistent with both common and rare allelic variants and gene × environment interaction. Advances in the field of neuroimaging have expanded our knowledge of intermediate phenotypes, the neurobiological processes that convey the risk from the genes to the complex phenotype. In this article, we review the recent and continuously accumulating evidence from in vivo imaging studies aiming at characterizing neurochemical intermediate phenotypes of schizophrenia. Dopaminergic alterations in schizophrenia are shared by individuals at genetic risk who do not express the illness, suggesting a "dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia vulnerability." This hypothesis has the potential to help us better understand the dopaminergic dysfunction in the context of the complex pathophysiological process leading to schizophrenia. In the future, neurotransmitter imaging studies should investigate the gene × environment interaction in schizophrenia, and try to identify neurobiological correlates of heightened sensitivity to environmental stressors (e.g., cannabis, childhood trauma, and other psychosocial stress) in genetically vulnerable individuals.},

Both the D2s and D2l receptors have been shown to couple to members of the G alpha(i) family of G proteins, but whether each isoform couples to specific G alpha(i) protein(s) remains controversial. In previous studies using G alpha(i) mutants resistant to modification by pertussis toxin (G alpha(i){PT}), we demonstrated that the D2s receptor couples selectively to G alpha(i2){PT} and that the D2l receptor couples selectively to G alpha(i3){PT} (Senogles, S. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23120-23127). In this study, two point mutations of the D2s receptor were created by random mutagenesis (R233G and A234T). The two mutant D2s receptors demonstrated pharmacological characteristics comparable with those of the wild-type D2s receptor, with similar agonist and antagonist binding affinities. We used human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with G alpha(i1){PT}, G alpha(i2){PT}, or G alpha(i3){PT} to measure agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated {cAMP} accumulation before and after pertussis toxin treatment. The two mutant D2s receptors demonstrated a change in G(i) coupling specificity compared with the wild-type D2s receptor. Whereas the wild-type D2s receptor coupled predominantly to G alpha(i2){PT}, mutant R233G coupled preferentially to G alpha(i3){PT}, and mutant A234T coupled preferentially to G alpha(i1){PT}. These results suggest that this region of the third cytoplasmic loop is crucial for determining G(i) protein coupling specificity.},

	abstract = {Chromosome 10q24.32-q24.33 is one of the most robustly supported risk loci to emerge from genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) of schizophrenia. However, extensive linkage disequilibrium makes it difficult to distinguish the actual susceptibility gene(s) at the locus, limiting its value for improving biological understanding of the condition. In the absence of coding changes that can account for the association, risk is likely conferred by altered regulation of one or more genes in the region. We, therefore, used highly sensitive measures of allele-specific expression to assess cis-regulatory effects associated with the two best-supported schizophrenia risk variants ({SNP} rs11191419 and indel ch10\_104957618\_I/rs202213518) on the primary positional candidates {BORCS}7, {AS}3MT, {CNNM}2, and {NT}5C2 in the human brain. Heterozygosity at rs11191419 was associated with increased allelic expression of {BORCS}7 and {AS}3MT in the fetal and adult brain, and with reduced allelic expression of {NT}5C2 in the adult brain. Heterozygosity at ch10\_104957618\_I was associated with reduced allelic expression of {NT}5C2 in both the fetal and adult brain. Comparisons between {cDNA} ratios in heterozygotes and homozygotes for the risk alleles indicated that cis-effects on {NT}5C2 expression in the adult dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could be largely accounted for by genotype at these two risk variants. While not excluding effects on other genes in the region, this study implicates altered neural expression of {BORCS}7, {AS}3MT, and {NT}5C2 in susceptibility to schizophrenia arising from genetic variation at the chromosome 10q24 locus. {\textbackslash}copyright 2016 The Authors.

We report that the intra-uterine environment modulates the association of schizophrenia with genomic risk (in this study, genome-wide association study-derived polygenic risk scores ({PRSs})). In independent samples from the United States, Italy, and Germany, the liability of schizophrenia explained by {PRS} is more than five times greater in the presence of early-life complications ({ELCs}) compared with their absence. Patients with {ELC} histories have significantly higher {PRS} than patients without {ELC} histories, which is confirmed in additional samples from Germany and Japan. The gene set composed of schizophrenia loci that interact with {ELCs} is highly expressed in placenta, is differentially expressed in placentae from complicated in comparison with normal pregnancies, and is differentially upregulated in placentae from male compared with female offspring. Pathway analyses reveal that genes driving the {PRS}-{ELC} interaction are involved in cellular stress response; genes that do not drive such interaction implicate orthogonal biological processes (for example, synaptic function). We conclude that a subset of the most significant genetic variants associated with schizophrenia converge on a developmental trajectory sensitive to events that affect the placental response to stress, which may offer insights into sex biases and primary prevention.},

Often, cell mosaicism is advantageous, ameliorating the deleterious effects of X-linked mutations and contributing to physiological diversity.

Most analyses rely on significance thresholds for identifying differentially expressed genes. We use an approach to compare gene expression datasets using 'threshold-free' comparisons. Significance cut-offs to identify genes shared between datasets may be too stringent and may miss concordant patterns of gene expression with potential biological relevance. A threshold-free approach gaining popularity in several research areas, including neuroscience, is Rank-Rank Hypergeometric Overlap ({RRHO}). Genes are ranked by their p-value and effect size direction, and ranked lists are compared to identify significantly overlapping genes across a continuous significance gradient rather than at a single arbitrary cut-off. We have updated the previous {RRHO} analysis by accurately detecting overlap of genes changed in the same and opposite directions between two datasets. Here, we use simulated and real data to show the drawbacks of the previous algorithm as well as the utility of our new algorithm. For example, we show the power of detecting discordant transcriptional patterns in the postmortem brain of subjects with psychiatric disorders.

	abstract = {We investigate parallel analysis ({PA}), a selection rule for the number-of-factors problem, from the point of view of permutation assessment. The idea of applying permutation test ideas to {PA} leads to a quasi-inferential, non-parametric version of {PA} which accounts not only for finite-sample bias but sampling variability as well. We give evidence, however, that quasi-inferential {PA} based on normal random variates (as opposed to data permutations) is surprisingly independent of distributional assumptions, and enjoys therefore certain non- parametric properties as well. This is a justification for providing tables for quasi-inferential {PA}. Based on permutation theory, we compare {PA} of principal components with {PA} of principal factor analysis and show that {PA} of principal factors may tend to select too many factors. We also apply parallel analysis to so-called resistant correlations and give evidence that this yields a slightly more conservative factor selection method. Finally, we apply {PA} to loadings and show how this provides benchmark values for loadings which are sensitive to the number of variables, number of subjects, and order of factors. These values therefore improve on conventional fixed thresholds such as 0.5 or 0.8 which are used irrespective of the size of the data.},

However, most expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}) remain unidentified. We mapped {eQTLs} by transcriptome sequencing in 1012 yeast segregants. The resulting {eQTLs} accounted for over 70\% of the heritability of {mRNA} levels, allowing comprehensive dissection of regulatory variation. Most genes had multiple {eQTLs}. Most expression variation arose from trans-acting {eQTLs} distant from their target genes. Nearly all trans-{eQTLs} clustered at 102 hotspot locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Fine-mapped hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes. While most genes had a local {eQTL}, most of these had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in trans. Hundreds of non-additive genetic interactions accounted for small fractions of expression variation. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail. {\textbackslash}copyright 2018, Albert et al.},

We leveraged this general {eQTL} database to show that 48.1\% of risk variants for schizophrenia associate with nearby expression. We lastly found 237 genes significantly differentially expressed between patients and controls, which replicated in an independent dataset, implicated synaptic processes, and were strongly regulated in early development.

Here, we introduce Cicero, an algorithm that identifies co-accessible pairs of {DNA} elements using single-cell chromatin accessibility data and so connects regulatory elements to their putative target genes. We apply Cicero to investigate how dynamically accessible elements orchestrate gene regulation in differentiating myoblasts. Groups of Cicero-linked regulatory elements meet criteria of "chromatin hubs"-they are enriched for physical proximity, interact with a common set of transcription factors, and undergo coordinated changes in histone marks that are predictive of changes in gene expression. Pseudotemporal analysis revealed that most {DNA} elements remain in chromatin hubs throughout differentiation. A subset of elements bound by {MYOD}1 in myoblasts exhibit early opening in a {PBX}1- and {MEIS}1-dependent manner.

Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types.

We introduce a natural Bayesian hierarchical model that treats the latent association status of molecular {QTLs} as {SNP}-level annotations for candidate {SNPs} of complex traits. We detail a computational procedure to seamlessly perform enrichment, fine-mapping and colocalization analyses, which is a distinct feature compared to the existing colocalization analysis procedures in the literature. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and requires only summary-level statistics. We evaluate and demonstrate the proposed computational approach through extensive simulation studies and analyses of blood lipid data and the whole blood {eQTL} data from the {GTEx} project. In addition, a useful utility from our proposed method enables the computation of expected colocalization signals using simple characteristics of the association data. Using this utility, we further illustrate the importance of enrichment analysis on the ability to discover colocalized signals and the potential limitations of currently available molecular {QTL} data.

Overall, our combined {GWAS} meta-analysis reaches N ∼700000 individuals and substantially increases the number of {GWAS} signals associated with these traits. We identified 3290 and 941 near-independent {SNPs} associated with height and {BMI}, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of P {\textbackslash}textless 1 × 10-8), including 1185 height-associated {SNPs} and 751 {BMI}-associated {SNPs} located within loci not previously identified by these two {GWAS}. The near-independent genome-wide significant {SNPs} explain ∼24.6\% of the variance of height and ∼6.0\% of the variance of {BMI} in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study ({HRS}). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these {SNPs} with actual height and {BMI} in {HRS} participants were ∼0.44 and ∼0.22, respectively.

Substance abuse is a predominantly male activity in this group, as elsewhere. Findings of sex differences in brain morphology are inconsistent but occur in areas that normally show sexual dimorphism, implying that the same factors are important drivers of sex differences in both normal neurodevelopmental processes and those associated with schizophrenia. There are sex differences in antipsychotic responses but sex-specific endocrine effects on illness and response to antipsychotics are potentially complex. Oestrogen's role as an adjunctive medication is not yet clear due to methodological differences between the few randomized controlled trials.

The development of the disease is mediated by a number of neural growth and development factors, suggesting that extensive changes in nerve structure and abnormal expression of genes in some important signalling pathways occur. Based on accumulating evidence, long non-coding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) play a crucial role in regulating neural diseases, including {SZ}. In the current study, we used mouse models of methamphetamine ({METH}) - and {MK}801-induced {SZ} to investigate changes in the expression of four {lncRNAs} (Meg3, Miat, Neat1 and Neat2) in the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}). Miat and Neat2 expression was significantly decreased in the {PFC} of the {SZ} model mice, regardless of whether the disease was induced by {MK}801 or {METH}. We further measured the levels of these {lncRNAs} in the peripheral blood ({PB}) collected from treated and untreated patients with {SZ} and from healthy controls. Neat1 and Neat2 levels were significantly decreased in the {PB} of untreated patients with {SZ}, but the trends in the expression of these {lncRNAs} nearly reached a normal level in treated patients with {SZ}. In conclusion, Neat2 and Miat may function as important regulators of {SZ}. Our findings provide important clues for new targets of {lncRNAs} that are involved in {SZ}.

	abstract = {Multi-{SNP} genetic association analysis has become increasingly important in analyzing data from genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) and molecular quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) mapping studies. In this paper, we propose novel computational approaches to address two outstanding issues in Bayesian multi-{SNP} genetic association analysis: namely, the control of false positive discoveries of identified association signals and the maximization of the efficiency of statistical inference by utilizing summary statistics. Quantifying the strength and uncertainty of genetic association signals has been a long-standing theme in statistical genetics. However, there is a lack of formal statistical procedures that can rigorously control type I errors in multi-{SNP} analysis. We propose an intuitive hierarchical representation of genetic association signals based on Bayesian posterior probabilities, which subsequently enables rigorous control of false discovery rate ({FDR}) and construction of Bayesian credible sets. From the perspective of statistical data reduction, we examine the computational approaches of multi-{SNP} analysis using z-statistics from single-{SNP} association testing and conclude that they likely yield conservative results comparing to using individual-level data. Built on this result, we propose a set of sufficient summary statistics that can lead to identical results as individual-level data without sacrificing power. Our novel computational approaches are implemented in the software package, {DAP}-G (https://github.com/xqwen/dap), which applies to both {GWASs} and genome-wide molecular {QTL} mapping studies. It is highly computationally efficient and approximately 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art implementation of Bayesian multi-{SNP} analysis software. We demonstrate the proposed computational approaches using carefully constructed simulation studies and illustrate a complete workflow for multi-{SNP} analysis of cis expression quantitative trait loci using the whole blood data from the {GTEx} project.},

Two unrelated families with {CMT}2C showed significant linkage to chromosome 12q24.11. We sequenced all genes in this region and identified two heterozygous missense mutations in the {TRPV}4 gene, C805T and G806A, resulting in the amino acid substitutions R269C and R269H. {TRPV}4 is a well-known member of the {TRP} superfamily of cation channels. In {TRPV}4-transfected cells, the {CMT}2C mutations caused marked cellular toxicity and increased constitutive and activated channel currents. Mutations in {TRPV}4 were previously associated with skeletal dysplasias. Our findings indicate that {TRPV}4 mutations can also cause a degenerative disorder of the peripheral nerves. The {CMT}2C-associated mutations lie in a distinct region of the {TRPV}4 ankyrin repeats, suggesting that this phenotypic variability may be due to differential effects on regulatory protein-protein interactions.},

We examine the functional outcome of 39 variants associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ({SLE}) through the integration of {GWAS} and {eQTL} data from the {TwinsUK} microarray and {RNA}-Seq cohort in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We use conditional analysis and a Bayesian colocalisation method to provide evidence of a shared causal-variant, then compare the ability of each quantification type to detect disease relevant {eQTLs} and {eGenes}. We discovered the greatest frequency of candidate-causal {eQTLs} using exon-level {RNA}-Seq, and identified novel {SLE} susceptibility genes (e.g. {NADSYN}1 and {TCF}7) that were concealed using microarrays, including four non-coding {RNAs}. Many of these {eQTLs} were found to influence the expression of several genes, supporting the notion that risk haplotypes may harbour multiple functional effects. Novel {SLE} associated splicing events were identified in the T-reg restricted transcription factor, {IKZF}2, and other candidate genes (e.g. {WDFY}4) through {asQTL} mapping using the Geuvadis cohort. We have significantly increased our understanding of the genetic control of gene-expression in {SLE} by maximising the leverage of {RNA}-Seq and performing integrative {GWAS}-{eQTL} analysis against gene, exon, and splice-junction quantifications. We conclude that to better understand the true functional consequence of regulatory variants, quantification by {RNA}-Seq should be performed at the exon-level as a minimum, and run in parallel with gene and splice-junction level quantification. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author 2017.

Our analysis revealed 296,485,284 bp in 125,715 distinct contigs present in the populations of African descent, demonstrating that the African pan-genome contains ∼10\% more {DNA} than the current human reference genome.

	abstract = {The dopaminergic system plays important roles in neuromodulation, such as motor control, motivation, reward, cognitive function, maternal, and reproductive behaviors. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, synthesized in both central nervous system and the periphery, that exerts its actions upon binding to G protein-coupled receptors. Dopamine receptors are widely expressed in the body and function in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems. Dopaminergic signaling pathways are crucial to the maintenance of physiological processes and an unbalanced activity may lead to dysfunctions that are related to neurodegenerative diseases. Unveiling the neurobiology and the molecular mechanisms that underlie these illnesses may contribute to the development of new therapies that could promote a better quality of life for patients worldwide. In this review, we summarize the aspects of dopamine as a catecholaminergic neurotransmitter and discuss dopamine signaling pathways elicited through dopamine receptor activation in normal brain function. Furthermore, we describe the potential involvement of these signaling pathways in evoking the onset and progression of some diseases in the nervous system, such as Parkinson's, Schizophrenia, Huntington's, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, and Addiction. A brief description of new dopaminergic drugs recently approved and under development treatments for these ailments is also provided.},

These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effect sizes among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect estimates and allows for more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity compared to simple shared or condition-specific assessments. We illustrate these features through an analysis of locally acting variants associated with gene expression (cis expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs})) in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more {eQTLs} than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. We show that although genetic effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes can still vary greatly among tissues. Some shared {eQTLs} show stronger effects in subsets of biologically related tissues (for example, brain-related tissues), or in only one tissue (for example, testis).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Transposable elements ({TE}) are an important source of evolutionary novelty in gene regulation. However, the mechanisms by which {TEs} contribute to gene expression are largely uncharacterized. {RESULTS}: Here, we leverage Roadmap and {GTEx} data to investigate the association of {TEs} with active and repressed chromatin in 24 tissues. We find 112 human {TE} families enriched in active regions of the genome across tissues. Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements ({SINEs}) and {DNA} transposons are the most frequently enriched classes, while Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons ({LTRs}) are often enriched in a tissue-specific manner. We report across-tissue variability in {TE} enrichment in active regions. Genes with consistent expression across tissues are less likely to be associated with {TE} insertions. {TE} presence in repressed regions similarly follows tissue-specific patterns. Moreover, different {TE} classes correlate with different repressive marks: {LTRs} and Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements ({LINEs}) are overrepresented in regions marked by H3K9me3, while the other {TEs} are more likely to overlap regions with H3K27me3. Young {TEs} are typically enriched in repressed regions and depleted in active regions. We detect multiple instances of {TEs} that are enriched in tissue-specific active regulatory regions. Such {TEs} contain binding sites for transcription factors that are master regulators for the given tissue. These {TEs} are enriched in intronic enhancers, and their tissue-specific enrichment correlates with tissue-specific variations in the expression of the nearest genes. {CONCLUSIONS}: We provide an integrated overview of the contribution of {TEs} to human gene regulation. Expanding previous analyses, we demonstrate that {TEs} can potentially contribute to the turnover of regulatory sequences in a tissue-specific fashion.},

Findings reveal a clear and pervasive pattern wherein African American/Black consumers show a rate of on average three to four higher than Euro-American/White consumers. Latino American/Hispanic consumers were also disproportionately diagnosed with psychotic disorders on average approximately three times higher compared to Euro-American/White consumers. In addition, a trend among international studies suggests that immigrant racial minority consumers receiving mental health services may be assigned a psychotic disorder diagnosis more frequently than native consumers sharing a majority racial background. Potential explanations for this phenomenon are discussed, including possible clinical bias and sociological causes such as differential access to healthcare and willingness to participate in mental health services.

The {PsychENCODE} resource contains ∼79,000 brain-active enhancers, sets of Hi-C linkages, and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci ({QTLs}); and further {QTLs} associated with chromatin, splicing, and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with {\textbackslash}textgreater88\% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by ∼6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.

Imputation has been successful for European ancestry populations in which very large reference panels are available. Smaller subsets of African descent populations are available in 1000 Genomes (1000G), the Consortium on Asthma among African ancestry Populations in the Americas ({CAAPA}) and the Haplotype Reference Consortium ({HRC}). We compared the performance of these reference panels when imputing variation in 3747 African Americans ({AA}) from two cohorts ({HCV} and {COPDGene}) genotyped using Illumina Omni microarrays. The haplotypes of 2504 (1000G), 883 ({CAAPA}) and 32,470 individuals ({HRC}) were used as reference. We compared the number of variants, imputation quality, imputation accuracy and coverage between panels. In both cohorts, 1000G imputed 1.5-1.6× more variants than {CAAPA} and 1.2× more than {HRC}. Similar findings were observed for variants with imputation R2 {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.5 and for rare, low-frequency, and common variants. When merging imputed variants of the three panels, the total number was 62-63 M with 20 M overlapping variants imputed by all three panels, and a range of 5-15 M variants imputed exclusively with one of them. For overlapping variants, imputation quality was highest for {HRC}, followed by 1000G, then {CAAPA}, and improved as the minor allele frequency increased. 1000G, {HRC} and {CAAPA} provided high performance and accuracy for imputation of African American individuals, increasing the number of variants available for subsequent analyses. These panels are complementary and would benefit from the development of an integrated African reference panel.},

However, comprehensive assessments of transcriptomic organization in diseased brains are limited. In this work, we integrated genotypes and {RNA} sequencing in brain samples from 1695 individuals with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, as well as controls. More than 25\% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest disease effects and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate disease-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing disease loci likely mediated by cis effects on brain expression. This transcriptome-wide characterization of the molecular pathology across three major psychiatric disorders provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development.

This inter-individual variation in drug response is driven by differences in gene interactions caused by each patient's genetic background, environmental exposures, and the proportions of specific cell types involved in disease. These gene interactions can now be captured by building gene regulatory networks, by taking advantage of {RNA} velocity (the time derivative of the gene expression state), the ability to study hundreds of thousands of cells simultaneously, and the falling price of single-cell sequencing. Here, we propose an integrative approach that leverages these recent advances in single-cell data with the sensitivity of bulk data to enable the reconstruction of personalized, cell-type- and context-specific gene regulatory networks. We expect this approach will allow the prioritization of key driver genes for specific diseases and will provide knowledge that opens new avenues towards improved personalized healthcare.},

	abstract = {Sex differences in the incidence and outcome of human disease are broadly recognized but, in most cases, not sufficiently understood to enable sex-specific approaches to treatment. Glioblastoma ({GBM}), the most common malignant brain tumor, provides a case in point. Despite well-established differences in incidence and emerging indications of differences in outcome, there are few insights that distinguish male and female {GBM} at the molecular level or allow specific targeting of these biological differences. Here, using a quantitative imaging-based measure of response, we found that standard therapy is more effective in female compared with male patients with {GBM}. We then applied a computational algorithm to linked {GBM} transcriptome and outcome data and identified sex-specific molecular subtypes of {GBM} in which cell cycle and integrin signaling are the critical determinants of survival for male and female patients, respectively. The clinical relevance of cell cycle and integrin signaling pathway signatures was further established through correlations between gene expression and in vitro chemotherapy sensitivity in a panel of male and female patient-derived {GBM} cell lines. Together, these results suggest that greater precision in {GBM} molecular subtyping can be achieved through sex-specific analyses and that improved outcomes for all patients might be accomplished by tailoring treatment to sex differences in molecular mechanisms.

	abstract = {Phenotypic discordance for schizophrenia in monozygotic twins clearly indicates involvement of environmental factors as key determinants in disease development. Positive findings from genome scans, linkage and association studies apply in only a minority of those affected, while post-mortem brain investigations reveal altered expression of genes and proteins involved in numerous neurodevelopmental, metabolic and neurotransmitter pathways. Such altered expressions could result, on the one hand, from mutations in coding regions or polymorphisms in the promoter and regulatory regions in genes within those areas identified by gene searches or, on the other hand, from inadequate amounts of modulators, transporters and synthesizers of transcription factors necessary for regulation of the putative genes. Hormones and vitamins are such modulators. They could serve as bridges between genes and environment in schizophrenia. Multiple evidence supports the suggestion of retinoids and thyroid hormones as plausible actors in these roles. Both are not only essential for normal development of the central nervous system but also regulate the expression of many neurotransmitters, their synthesizing enzymes and receptors, and other genes in broader signaling transduction cascades affecting pathways that are altered in response to treatment. Functional and positional candidate genes include retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors, retinaldehyde dehydrogenases and deiodinases, which synthesize the powerful morphogens, retinoic acid and triiodothyronine, and the enzymes involved in their inactivation. This review highlights selective evidence supporting the retinoid and thyroid hormone hypotheses of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {In predictive model development, gene expression data is associated with the unique challenge that the number of samples (n) is much smaller than the amount of features (p). This "n ≪ p" property has prevented classification of gene expression data from deep learning techniques, which have been proved powerful under "n {\textbackslash}textgreater p" scenarios in other application fields, such as image classification. Further, the sparsity of effective features with unknown correlation structures in gene expression profiles brings more challenges for classification tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose a newly developed classifier named Forest Deep Neural Network ({fDNN}), to integrate the deep neural network architecture with a supervised forest feature detector. Using this built-in feature detector, the method is able to learn sparse feature representations and feed the representations into a neural network to mitigate the overfitting problem. Simulation experiments and real data analyses using two {RNA}-seq expression datasets are conducted to evaluate {fDNN}'s capability. The method is demonstrated a useful addition to current predictive models with better classification performance and more meaningful selected features compared to ordinary random forests and deep neural networks.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Dwindling discovery pipelines, rapidly expanding R\&D budgets and increasing regulatory control, predict significant gaps in the future drug markets. The cumulative duration of discovery from concept to commercialisation is unacceptably lengthy, and adds to the deepening crisis. Existing animal models predicting clinical translations are simplistic, highly reductionist and, therefore, not fit for purpose. The catastrophic consequences of ever-increasing attrition rates are most likely to be felt in the developing world, where resistance acquisition by killer diseases like malaria, tuberculosis and {HIV} have paced far ahead of new drug discovery. The coming of age of Omics-based applications makes available a formidable technological resource to further expand our knowledge of the complexities of human disease. The standardisation, analysis and comprehensive collation of the "data-heavy" outputs of these sciences are indeed challenging. A renewed focus on increasing reproducibility by understanding inherent biological, methodological, technical and analytical variables is crucial if reliable and useful inferences with potential for translation are to be achieved. The individual Omics sciences-genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics-have the singular advantage of being complimentary for cross validation, and together could potentially enable a much-needed systems biology perspective of the perturbations underlying disease processes. If current adverse trends are to be reversed, it is imperative that a shift in the R\&D focus from speed to quality is achieved.

In multiple sclerosis ({MS}), demyelination in the central nervous system thus leads to neurodegeneration, but the severity of {MS} between patients is very variable. Disability does not correlate well with the extent of demyelination1, which suggests that other factors contribute to this variability. One such factor may be oligodendrocyte heterogeneity. Not all oligodendrocytes are the same-those from the mouse spinal cord inherently produce longer myelin sheaths than those from the cortex2, and single-cell analysis of the mouse central nervous system identified further differences3,4. However, the extent of human oligodendrocyte heterogeneity and its possible contribution to {MS} pathology remain unknown. Here we performed single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing from white matter areas of post-mortem human brain from patients with {MS} and from unaffected controls. We identified subclusters of oligodendroglia in control human white matter, some with similarities to mouse, and defined new markers for these cell states. Notably, some subclusters were underrepresented in {MS} tissue, whereas others were more prevalent. These differences in mature oligodendrocyte subclusters may indicate different functional states of oligodendrocytes in {MS} lesions. We found similar changes in normal-appearing white matter, showing that {MS} is a more diffuse disease than its focal demyelination suggests. Our findings of an altered oligodendroglial heterogeneity in {MS} may be important for understanding disease progression and developing therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Simulation of genetic variants data is frequently required for the evaluation of statistical methods in the fields of human and animal genetics. Although a number of high-quality genetic simulators have been developed, many of them require advanced knowledge in population genetics or in computation to be used effectively. In addition, generating simulated data in the context of family-based studies demands sophisticated methods and advanced computer programming. {RESULTS}: To address these issues, we propose a new user-friendly and integrated R package, sim1000G, which simulates variants in genomic regions among unrelated individuals or among families. The only input needed is a raw phased Variant Call Format ({VCF}) file. Haplotypes are extracted to compute linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) in the simulated genomic regions and for the generation of new genotype data among unrelated individuals. The covariance across variants is used to preserve the {LD} structure of the original population. Pedigrees of arbitrary sizes are generated by modeling recombination events with sim1000G. To illustrate the application of sim1000G, various scenarios are presented assuming unrelated individuals from a single population or two distinct populations, or alternatively for three-generation pedigree data. Sim1000G can capture allele frequency diversity, short and long-range linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) patterns and subtle population differences in {LD} structure without the need of any tuning parameters. {CONCLUSION}: Sim1000G fills a gap in the vast area of genetic variants simulators by its simplicity and independence from external tools. Currently, it is one of the few simulation packages completely integrated into R and able to simulate multiple genetic variants among unrelated individuals and within families. Its implementation will facilitate the application and development of computational methods for association studies with both rare and common variants.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Exact tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are widely used in genetic association studies. We evaluate the mid p-value, unknown in the genetics literature, as an alternative for the standard p-value in the exact test. {METHOD}: The type 1 error rate and the power of the exact test are calculated for different sample sizes, significance levels, minor allele counts and degrees of deviation from equilibrium. Three different p-value are considered: the standard two-sided p-value, the doubled one-sided p-value and the mid p-value. Practical implications of using the mid p-value are discussed with {HapMap} datasets and a data set on colon cancer. {RESULTS}: The mid p-value is shown to have a type 1 error rate that is always closer to the nominal level, and to have better power. Differences between the standard p-value and the mid p-value can be large for insignificant results, and are smaller for significant results. The analysis of empirical databases shows that the mid p-value uncovers more significant markers, and that the equilibrium null distribution is not tenable for both databases. {CONCLUSION}: The standard exact p-value is overly conservative, in particular for small minor allele frequencies. The mid p-value ameliorates this problem by bringing the rejection rate closer to the nominal level, at the price of occasionally exceeding the nominal level.},

We identified 102 independent variants, 269 genes, and 15 genesets associated with depression, including both genes and gene pathways associated with synaptic structure and neurotransmission. An enrichment analysis provided further evidence of the importance of prefrontal brain regions. In an independent replication sample of 1,306,354 individuals (414,055 cases and 892,299 controls), 87 of the 102 associated variants were significant after multiple testing correction.

Gene-level association methods such as {PrediXcan} can prioritize candidate targets. However, limited {eQTL} sample sizes and absence of relevant developmental and disease context restrict our ability to detect associations. Here we propose an efficient statistical method ({MultiXcan}) that leverages the substantial sharing of {eQTLs} across tissues and contexts to improve our ability to identify potential target genes. {MultiXcan} integrates evidence across multiple panels using multivariate regression, which naturally takes into account the correlation structure. We apply our method to simulated and real traits from the {UK} Biobank and show that, in realistic settings, we can detect a larger set of significantly associated genes than using each panel separately. To improve applicability, we developed a summary result-based extension called S-{MultiXcan}, which we show yields highly concordant results with the individual level version when {LD} is well matched. Our multivariate model-based approach allowed us to use the individual level results as a gold standard to calibrate and develop a robust implementation of the summary-based extension. Results from our analysis as well as software and necessary resources to apply our method are publicly available.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) have identified many genomic loci associated with risk for schizophrenia, but unambiguous identification of the relationship between disease-associated variants and specific genes, and in particular their effect on risk conferring transcripts, has proven difficult. To better understand the specific molecular mechanism(s) at the schizophrenia locus in 11q25, we undertook cis expression quantitative trait loci (cis-{eQTL}) mapping for this 2 megabase genomic region using postmortem human brain samples. To comprehensively assess the effects of genetic risk upon local expression, we evaluated multiple transcript features: genes, exons, and exon-exon junctions in multiple brain regions-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}), hippocampus, and caudate. Genetic risk variants strongly associated with expression of {SNX}19 transcript features that tag multiple rare classes of {SNX}19 transcripts, whereas they only weakly affected expression of an exon-exon junction that tags the majority of abundant transcripts. The most prominent class of {SNX}19 risk-associated transcripts is predicted to be overexpressed, defined by an exon-exon splice junction between exons 8 and 10 (junc8.10) and that is predicted to encode proteins that lack the characteristic nexin C terminal domain. Risk alleles were also associated with either increased or decreased expression of multiple additional classes of transcripts. With {RACE}, molecular cloning, and long read sequencing, we found a number of novel {SNX}19 transcripts that further define the set of potential etiological transcripts. We explored epigenetic regulation of {SNX}19 expression and found that {DNA} methylation at {CpG} sites near the primary transcription start site and within exon 2 partially mediate the effects of risk variants on risk-associated expression. {ATAC} sequencing revealed that some of the most strongly risk-associated {SNPs} are located within a region of open chromatin, suggesting a nearby regulatory element is involved. These findings indicate a potentially complex molecular etiology, in which risk alleles for schizophrenia generate epigenetic alterations and dysregulation of multiple classes of {SNX}19 transcripts.},

In the analysis of {BS}-seq data, this can present an important performance bottleneck that can be mitigated by appropriate algorithmic and software-engineering improvements. One strategy is to modify the read-alignment algorithms by integrating the logic related to {BS}-seq alignment, with the goal of making the software implementation amenable to optimizations that lead to higher speed and greater sensitivity than might otherwise be attainable. {RESULTS}: We evaluated this strategy using Arioc, a short-read aligner that uses {GPU} (general-purpose graphics processing unit) hardware to accelerate computationally-expensive programming logic. We integrated the {BS}-seq computational logic into both {GPU} and {CPU} code throughout the Arioc implementation. We then carried out a read-by-read comparison of Arioc's reported alignments with the alignments reported by well-known {CPU}-based {BS}-seq read aligners. With simulated reads, Arioc's accuracy is equal to or better than the other read aligners we evaluated. With human sequencing reads, Arioc's throughput is at least 10 times faster than existing {BS}-seq aligners across a wide range of sensitivity settings. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The Arioc software is available for download at https://github.com/{RWilton}/Arioc.

	abstract = {Motivation: Genome-wide datasets produced for association studies have dramatically increased in size over the past few years, with modern datasets commonly including millions of variants measured in dozens of thousands of individuals. This increase in data size is a major challenge severely slowing down genomic analyses, leading to some software becoming obsolete and researchers having limited access to diverse analysis tools. Results: Here we present two R packages, bigstatsr and bigsnpr, allowing for the analysis of large scale genomic data to be performed within R. To address large data size, the packages use memory-mapping for accessing data matrices stored on disk instead of in {RAM}. To perform data pre-processing and data analysis, the packages integrate most of the tools that are commonly used, either through transparent system calls to existing software, or through updated or improved implementation of existing methods. In particular, the packages implement fast and accurate computations of principal component analysis and association studies, functions to remove {SNPs} in linkage disequilibrium and algorithms to learn polygenic risk scores on millions of {SNPs}. We illustrate applications of the two R packages by analyzing a case-control genomic dataset for celiac disease, performing an association study and computing Polygenic Risk Scores. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the R packages by analyzing a simulated genome-wide dataset including 500,000 individuals and 1 million markers on a single desktop computer.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The objective of this study was to estimate the {US} societal economic burden of schizophrenia and update the 2002 reported costs of {\textbackslash}62.7 billion given the disease management and health care structural changes of the last decade. {METHODS}: A prevalence-based approach was used to assess direct health care costs, direct non-health care costs, and indirect costs associated with schizophrenia ({ICD}-9 codes 295.xx) for 2013, with cost adjustments where necessary. Direct health care costs were estimated using a retrospective matched cohort design using the Truven Health Analytics {MarketScan} Commercial Claims and Encounters, Medicare Supplemental, and Medicaid Multistate databases. Direct non-health care costs were estimated for law enforcement, homeless shelters, and research and training. Indirect costs were estimated for productivity loss from unemployment, reduced work productivity among the employed, premature mortality (ie, suicide), and caregiving. {RESULTS}: The economic burden of schizophrenia was estimated at {\textbackslash}155.7 billion ({\textbackslash}134.4 billion-{\textbackslash}174.3 billion based on sensitivity analyses) for 2013 and included excess direct health care costs of {\textbackslash}37.7 billion (24\%), direct non-health care costs of {\textbackslash}9.3 billion (6\%), and indirect costs of \$117.3 billion (76\%) compared to individuals without schizophrenia. The largest components were excess costs associated with unemployment (38\%), productivity loss due to caregiving (34\%), and direct health care costs (24\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: Schizophrenia is associated with a significant economic burden where, in addition to direct health care costs, indirect and non-health care costs are strong contributors, suggesting that therapies should aim at improving not only symptom control but also cognition and functional performance, which are associated with substantial non-health care and indirect costs. {\textbackslash}copyright Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental phenotypes diagnosed in more than 1\% of children. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to {ASD} susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with {ASD}. With a marked sample-size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with {ASD} and 27,969 controls that identified five genome-wide-significant loci. Leveraging {GWAS} results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across {ASD} subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that {GWAS} performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in {ASD}.},

	abstract = {Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease ({LOAD}), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify {LOAD} risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed {LOAD} (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous {LOAD} risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci ({IQCK}, {ACE}, {ADAM}10, {ADAMTS}1, and {WWOX}), two of which ({ADAM}10, {ACE}) were identified in a recent genome-wide association ({GWAS})-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen ({HLA}) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype {HLA}-{DR}15 as a risk factor for {LOAD}. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein ({APP}) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting {APP} and A{\textbackslash}beta processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with {LOAD}. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 × 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between {LOAD} and traits such as family history of dementia and education.},

	abstract = {Background: Activated or impaired T-cell function in inflammatory and degenerative process can contribute to the risk and progression of schizophrenia. This study used immune repertoire sequencing to investigate the T-cell receptor beta variable chain ({TRBV}) presence in blood mononuclear cells in the violent or non-violent schizophrenic patients. Methods: Ten violent and 10 non-violent schizophrenic patients and 8 matched healthy controls were enrolled. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ({BPRS}) was used to evaluate patients' psychiatric symptoms. The level of aggression was assessed using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale ({MOAS}). The complementarity-determining region 3 ({CDR}3) of {TRBV} was detected using multiplex-{PCR} and high-throughput sequencing. Results: The {TCR} repertoire diversity were no significant differences in the Shannon-Wiener or inverse Simpson diversity index between three groups. Principal component analysis ({PCA}) of {TRBV} composition and abundance showed that principal component 1 and principal component 2 can explain 28.88 and 13.24\% of total variation, respectively. Schizophrenic patients (violent and non-violent) had significantly different V gene distribution compared to healthy controls. In particular, {TRBV}2 occurred at a significantly higher frequency in the violent schizophrenia group than in the non-violent schizophrenia and healthy control groups, and {TRBV}7-2 occurred at a significantly higher frequency in the non-violent schizophrenia group than in the violent schizophrenia and healthy control groups. Conclusions: The results suggest that violent and non-violent schizophrenic patients carry abnormal T-cell receptor repertoires, and these data provide a useful clue to explore the etiology of violent behavior in schizophrenia.},

Epigenome-wide association study ({EWAS}) provide a systematic approach to uncovering epigenetic variants underlying common diseases/phenotypes.

To meet the requirements of users, we developed a convenient and useful software, {EWAS}2.0. {RESULTS}: {EWAS}2.0 can analyze {EWAS} data and identify the association between epigenetic variations and disease/phenotype. On the basis of {EWAS}1.0, we have added more distinctive features. {EWAS}2.0 software was developed based on our 'population epigenetic framework' and can perform: (i) epigenome-wide single marker association study; (ii) epigenome-wide methylation haplotype (meplotype) association study and (iii) epigenome-wide association meta-analysis. Users can use {EWAS}2.0 to execute chi-square test, t-test, linear regression analysis, logistic regression analysis, identify the association between epi-alleles, identify the methylation disequilibrium ({MD}) blocks, calculate the {MD} coefficient, the frequency of meplotype and Pearson's correlation coefficients and carry out meta-analysis and so on.

	abstract = {Repeated administration of antipsychotic drugs to normal rats has been shown to induce a state of dopamine neuron inactivation known as depolarization block, which correlates with the ability of the drugs to exhibit antipsychotic efficacy and extrapyramidal side effects in schizophrenia patients. Nonetheless, in normal rats depolarization block requires weeks of antipsychotic drug administration, whereas schizophrenia patients exhibit initial effects soon after initiating antipsychotic drug treatment. We now report that, in a developmental disruption rat model of schizophrenia [methyl-azoxymethanol acetate (20 mg/kg, i.p.) injected into G17 pregnant female rats, with offspring tested as adults], the extant hyperdopaminergic state combines with the excitatory actions of a first- (haloperidol; 0.6 mg/kg, i.p.) and a second- (sertindole; 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) generation antipsychotic drug to rapidly induce depolarization block in ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. Acute injection of either antipsychotic drug induced an immediate reduction in the number of spontaneously active dopamine neurons (cells per electrode track; termed population activity). Repeated administration of either antipsychotic drug for 1, 3, 7, 15, and 21 d continued to reduce dopamine neuron population activity. Both acute and repeated effects on population activity were reversed by acute apomorphine injections, which is consistent with the reversal of dopamine neuron depolarization block. Although this action may account for the effects of D2 antagonist drugs on alleviating psychosis and the lack of development of tolerance in humans, the drugs appear to do so by inducing an offsetting deficit rather than attacking the primary pathology present in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {The substantia nigra ({SN}) provides the largest dopaminergic input to the brain, projects to the striatum (the primary locus of action for antipsychotic medication), and receives {GABAergic} and glutamatergic inputs. This study used western blot analysis to compare protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase ({TH}), glutamate decarboxylase ({GAD}67), and vesicular glutamate transporters ({vGLUT}1 and {vGLUT}2) in postmortem human {SN} in schizophrenia subjects (n=13) and matched controls (n=12). As a preliminary analysis, the schizophrenia group was subdivided by (1) treatment status: off medication (n=4) or on medication (n=9); or (2) treatment response: treatment resistant (n=5) or treatment responsive (n=4). The combined schizophrenia group had higher {TH} and {GAD}67 protein levels than controls (an increase of 69.6\%, P=0.01 and 19.5\%, P=0.004, respectively). When subdivided by medication status, these increases were found in the on-medication subjects ({TH} 88.3\%, P=0.008; {GAD}67 40.6\%, P=0.003). In contrast, unmedicated schizophrenia subjects had higher {vGLUT}2 levels than controls (an increase of 28.7\%, P=0.041), but {vGLUT}2 levels were similar between medicated schizophrenia subjects and controls. Treatment-resistant subjects had significantly higher {TH} and {GAD}67 levels than controls (an increase of 121.0\%, P=0.0003 and 58.7\%, P=0.004, respectively). These data suggest increases in dopamine and {GABA} transmission in the {SN} in schizophrenia, with a potential relation to treatment and response.},

	abstract = {Although the basis of schizophrenia is not known, evidence indicates a possible overactivity of dopamine pathways. In order to detect any new dopamine receptor-like sites which may be altered in schizophrenia, the present study used a new radioligand, a [3H]benzo[g]quinoline. The receptors were labelled by this ligand in the presence of other drugs to block the known dopamine D1, D2, D3, or D5 receptors (no D4-selective ligands are available to block D4). Using this method, we found that schizophrenia brain striata had elevated levels of a D2-like site not detected in control human postmortem brains or in Alzheimer's, Huntington's, or Parkinson's disease brains. The ligand acted as an agonist at this D2-like site, because binding was abolished by guanine nucleotide. The binding of the ligand to the D4 receptor, however, was not sensitive to guanine nucleotide. The site differed from D2 itself, because S- and R-sulpiride were equally potent at the D2-like site. The D2-like sites were present in rat and mouse brain but were absent in brain slices from transgenic mice where D2 had been knocked out. The abundance of the receptor was not related to premortem use of antipsychotic drugs. Future research should examine the biochemical differences between the D2 dopamine receptor and these D2-like sites in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Immigrant groups in Western Europe have markedly increased rates of schizophrenia. The highest rates are found in ethnic groups that are predominantly black. Separating minority race/ethnicity from immigration in Western Europe is difficult; in the {US}, these issues can be examined separately. Here we compared rates of schizophrenia between whites and African Americans and evaluated whether the association was mediated by socioeconomic status ({SES}) of family of origin in a {US} birth cohort. {METHODS}: Study subjects were offspring of women enrolled during pregnancy at Alameda County Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan clinics (1959-66) in the Child Health and Development Study. For schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 12 094 of the 19 044 live births were followed over 1981-97. The analysis is restricted to cohort members whose mothers identified as African American or white at intake. Stratified proportional hazards regression was the method of analysis; the robustness of findings to missing data bias was assessed using multiple imputation. {RESULTS}: African Americans were about 3-fold more likely than whites to be diagnosed with schizophrenia [Rate Ratio ({RR}) = 3.27; 95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 1.71-6.27]. After adjusting for indicators of family {SES} at birth, the {RR} was about 2-fold ({RR} = 1.92; 95\% {CI}: 0.86-4.28). Using multiple imputation in the model including family {SES} indicators, the {RR} for race and schizophrenia was strengthened in comparison with the estimate obtained without imputation. {CONCLUSION}: The data indicate substantially elevated rates of schizophrenia among African Americans in comparison with whites in this birth cohort. The association may have been partly but not wholly mediated by an effect of race on family {SES}.},

Because most patients with schizophrenia are treated with neuroleptic drugs that block D2 dopamine receptors in the caudate nucleus, it has been suggested that this increase in the number of receptors is a result of adaptation to these drugs rather than a biochemical abnormality intrinsic to schizophrenia. With positron emission tomography ({PET}), the D2 dopamine receptor density in the caudate nucleus of living human beings was measured in normal volunteers and in two groups of patients with schizophrenia–one group that had never been treated with neuroleptics and another group that had been treated with these drugs. D2 dopamine receptor densities in the caudate nucleus were higher in both groups of patients than in the normal volunteers. Thus, schizophrenia itself is associated with an increase in brain D2 dopamine receptor density.},

	abstract = {Despite the substantial impact of sleep disturbances on human health and the many years of study dedicated to understanding sleep pathologies, the underlying genetic mechanisms that govern sleep and wake largely remain unknown. Recently, the authors completed large-scale genetic and gene expression analyses in a segregating inbred mouse cross and identified candidate causal genes that regulate the mammalian sleep-wake cycle, across multiple traits including total sleep time, amounts of rapid eye movement ({REM}), non-{REM}, sleep bout duration, and sleep fragmentation. Here the authors describe a novel approach toward validating candidate causal genes, while also identifying potential targets for sleep-related indications. Select small-molecule antagonists and agonists were used to interrogate candidate causal gene function in rodent sleep polysomnography assays to determine impact on overall sleep architecture and to evaluate alignment with associated sleep-wake traits. Significant effects on sleep architecture were observed in validation studies using compounds targeting the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 subunit (Chrm3) (wake promotion), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha4 subunit (Chrna4) (wake promotion), dopamine receptor D5 subunit (Drd5) (sleep induction), serotonin 1D receptor (Htr1d) (altered {REM} fragmentation), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp1r) (light sleep promotion and reduction of deep sleep), and calcium channel, voltage-dependent, T type, alpha 1I subunit (Cacna1i) (increased bout duration of slow wave sleep). Taken together, these results show the complexity of genetic components that regulate sleep-wake traits and highlight the importance of evaluating this complex behavior at a systems level. Pharmacological validation of genetically identified putative targets provides a rapid alternative to generating knock out or transgenic animal models, and may ultimately lead towards new therapeutic opportunities.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The genetic risk factors of schizophrenia ({SCZ}), a severe psychiatric disorder, are not yet fully understood. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in {SCZ}, but comprehensive association studies are lacking. We hypothesized that variants in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes influence susceptibility to {SCZ}. {METHODS}: We conducted gene-based and gene-set analyses using summary association results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Schizophrenia Phase 2 ({PGC}-{SCZ}2) genome-wide association study comprising 35,476 cases and 46,839 control subjects. We applied the {MAGMA} method to three sets of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes: oxidative phosphorylation genes, other nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, and genes involved in nucleus-mitochondria crosstalk. Furthermore, we conducted a replication study using the {iPSYCH} {SCZ} sample of 2290 cases and 21,621 control subjects. {RESULTS}: In the {PGC}-{SCZ}2 sample, 1186 mitochondrial genes were analyzed, among which 159 had p values {\textbackslash}textless .05 and 19 remained significant after multiple testing correction. A meta-analysis of 818 genes combining the {PGC}-{SCZ}2 and {iPSYCH} samples resulted in 104 nominally significant and nine significant genes, suggesting a polygenic model for the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. Gene-set analysis, however, did not show significant results. In an in silico protein-protein interaction network analysis, 14 mitochondrial genes interacted directly with 158 {SCZ} risk genes identified in {PGC}-{SCZ}2 (permutation p = .02), and aldosterone signaling in epithelial cells and mitochondrial dysfunction pathways appeared to be overrepresented in this network of mitochondrial and {SCZ} risk genes. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study provides evidence that specific aspects of mitochondrial function may play a role in {SCZ}, but we did not observe its broad involvement even using a large sample.

	abstract = {From genomic association studies, quantitative trait loci analysis, and epigenomic mapping, it is evident that significant efforts are necessary to define genetic-epigenetic interactions and understand their role in disease susceptibility and progression. For this reason, an analysis of the effects of genetic variation on gene expression and {DNA} methylation in human placentas at high resolution and whole-genome coverage will have multiple mechanistic and practical implications. By producing and analyzing {DNA} sequence variation (n = 303), {DNA} methylation (n = 303) and {mRNA} expression data (n = 80) from placentas from healthy women, we investigate the regulatory landscape of the human placenta and offer analytical approaches to integrate different types of genomic data and address some potential limitations of current platforms. We distinguish two profiles of interaction between expression and {DNA} methylation, revealing linear or bimodal effects, reflecting differences in genomic context, transcription factor recruitment, and possibly cell subpopulations. These findings help to clarify the interactions of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in normal human placentas. They also provide strong evidence for genotype-driven modifications of transcription and {DNA} methylation in normal placentas. In addition to these mechanistic implications, the data and analytical methods presented here will improve the interpretability of genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies for human traits and diseases that involve placental functions.},

Incongruence in the conclusions reached in some recent reports has been attributed to different high-throughput approaches to transcriptome analysis. However, recent reports each utilizing {RNA}-seq to gauge X-linked gene expression relative to autosomal gene expression also arrived at diametrically opposed conclusions regarding X chromosome dosage compensation in mammals. {RESULTS}: Here we analyze {RNA}-seq data from X-monosomic female human and mouse tissues, which are uncomplicated by genes that escape X-inactivation, as well as published {RNA}-seq data to describe relative X expression ({RXE}). We find that the determination of {RXE} is highly dependent upon a variety of computational, statistical and biological assumptions underlying {RNA}-seq analysis. Parameters implemented in short-read mapping programs, choice of reference genome annotation, expression data distribution, tissue source for {RNA} and {RNA}-seq library construction method have profound effects on comparing expression levels across chromosomes. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our analysis shows that the high number of paralogous gene families on the mammalian X chromosome relative to autosomes contributes to the ambiguity in {RXE} calculations, {RNA}-seq analysis that takes into account that single- and multi-copy genes are compensated differently supports the conclusion that, in many somatic tissues, the mammalian X is up-regulated compared to the autosomes.},

Unpredicted findings illustrate the power of {iPSCs} as a discovery tool, but may also be attributable to limitations in modeling dynamic neural networks or difficulty in identifying the most affected neural subtype or developmental stage. {SUMMARY}: Technological advances in differentiation protocols and organoid generation will enhance our ability to model the salient pathology underlying psychiatric disorders using {iPSCs}. The field will also benefit from context-driven interpretations of {iPSC} studies that recognize all potential sources of variability, including differences in patient symptomatology, genetic risk factors and affected cellular subtype.},

	abstract = {Genotype imputation is commonly performed in genome-wide association studies because it greatly increases the number of markers that can be tested for association with a trait. In general, one should perform genotype imputation using the largest reference panel that is available because the number of accurately imputed variants increases with reference panel size. However, one impediment to using larger reference panels is the increased computational cost of imputation. We present a new genotype imputation method, Beagle 5.0, which greatly reduces the computational cost of imputation from large reference panels. We compare Beagle 5.0 with Beagle 4.1, Impute4, Minimac3, and Minimac4 using 1000 Genomes Project data, Haplotype Reference Consortium data, and simulated data for 10k, 100k, 1M, and 10M reference samples. All methods produce nearly identical accuracy, but Beagle 5.0 has the lowest computation time and the best scaling of computation time with increasing reference panel size. For 10k, 100k, 1M, and 10M reference samples and 1,000 phased target samples, Beagle 5.0's computation time is 3× (10k), 12× (100k), 43× (1M), and 533× (10M) faster than the fastest alternative method. Cost data from the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud show that Beagle 5.0 can perform genome-wide imputation from 10M reference samples into 1,000 phased target samples at a cost of less than one {US} cent per sample.

Here, we analysed 80,660 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Our single-cell transcriptomic resource provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease.},

Eight of the 19 variants that were genome-wide significant (P {\textbackslash}textless 5 × 10-8) in the discovery {GWAS} were not genome-wide significant in the combined analysis, consistent with small effect sizes and limited power but also with genetic heterogeneity. In the combined analysis, 30 loci were genome-wide significant, including 20 newly identified loci. The significant loci contain genes encoding ion channels, neurotransmitter transporters and synaptic components. Pathway analysis revealed nine significantly enriched gene sets, including regulation of insulin secretion and endocannabinoid signaling. Bipolar I disorder is strongly genetically correlated with schizophrenia, driven by psychosis, whereas bipolar {II} disorder is more strongly correlated with major depressive disorder.

	abstract = {Early genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-{eQTL} {SNPs}, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {High-throughput measurements of molecular phenotypes provide an unprecedented opportunity to model cellular processes and their impact on disease. These highly structured datasets are usually strongly confounded, creating false positives and reducing power. This has motivated many approaches based on principal components analysis ({PCA}) to estimate and correct for confounders, which have become indispensable elements of association tests between molecular phenotypes and both genetic and nongenetic factors. Here, we show that these correction approaches induce a bias, and that it persists for large sample sizes and replicates out-of-sample. We prove this theoretically for {PCA} by deriving an analytic, deterministic, and intuitive bias approximation. We assess other methods with realistic simulations, which show that perturbing any of several basic parameters can cause false positive rate ({FPR}) inflation. Our experiments show the bias depends on covariate and confounder sparsity, effect sizes, and their correlation. Surprisingly, when the covariate and confounder have [Formula: see text], standard two-step methods all have [Formula: see text]-fold {FPR} inflation. Our analysis informs best practices for confounder correction in genomic studies, and suggests many false discoveries have been made and replicated in some differential expression analyses.

	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

We now introduce {CIBERSORTx}, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, {CIBERSORTx} also allows the use of single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of {CIBERSORTx} in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells.},

Moreover, our results show that dysregulation of specific groups of genes in cortico-cortical projection neurons correlates with clinical severity of autism. These findings suggest that molecular changes in upper-layer cortical circuits are linked to behavioral manifestations of autism.

	abstract = {There is ample evidence for localization of messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}) and protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites; however, demonstrations of these processes in presynaptic terminals are limited. We used expansion microscopy to resolve pre- and postsynaptic compartments in rodent neurons. Most presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus and forebrain contained {mRNA} and ribosomes. We sorted fluorescently labeled mouse brain synaptosomes and then sequenced hundreds of {mRNA} species present within excitatory boutons. After brief metabolic labeling, {\textbackslash}textgreater30\% of all presynaptic terminals exhibited a signal, providing evidence for ongoing protein synthesis. We tested different classic plasticity paradigms and observed distinct patterns of rapid pre- and/or postsynaptic translation. Thus, presynaptic terminals are translationally competent, and local protein synthesis is differentially recruited to drive compartment-specific phenotypes that underlie different forms of plasticity.

We hypothesized that a T-cell receptor ({TCR}) clonal repertoire 'signature' could distinguish {HAM}/{TSP} patients from healthy controls, as well as from patients with a more heterogeneous {CNS}-reactive inflammatory disease such as {MS}. In this study, we applied an unbiased molecular technique - unique molecular identifier ({UMI}) library-based strategy to investigate with high accuracy the {TCR} clonal repertoire by high throughput sequencing ({HTS}) technology. {cDNA}-{TCR} {\textbackslash}beta-chain libraries were sequenced from 2 million peripheral mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}) in 14 {HAM}/{TSP} patients, 34 {MS} patients and 20 healthy controls ({HC}). While {HAM}/{TSP} patients showed a higher clonal T-cell expansion compared to {MS} and {HC}, increase of the {TCR} clonal expansion was inversely correlated with the diversity of {TCR} repertoire in all subjects. In addition, longitudinal analysis of {TCR} repertoires from {HAM}/{TSP} patients demonstrated a correlation of the {TCR} clonal expansion with {HTLV}-I proviral load. Surprisingly, {MS} patients showed a higher diversity of {TCR} repertoires than other groups. Despite higher {TCR} clonal expansions in {HAM}/{TSP} patients, no disease-specific {TCRs} were shared among patients. Only non-shared or "private" {TCR} repertoires was observed. While no clones that shared the same {CDR}3 amino acid sequences were seen in either {HC} or {MS} patients, there was a cluster of related {CDR}3 amino acid sequences observed for 18 out of 34 {MS} patients when evaluated by phylogenetic tree analysis. This suggests that a {TCR}-repertoire signature may be identified in a subset of patients with {MS}.},

Human brain organoids hold unprecedented promise for this purpose; however, they are plagued by high organoid-to-organoid variability2,3. This has raised doubts as to whether developmental processes of the human brain can occur outside the context of embryogenesis with a degree of reproducibility that is comparable to the endogenous tissue. Here we show that an organoid model of the dorsal forebrain can reliably generate a rich diversity of cell types appropriate for the human cerebral cortex. We performed single-cell {RNA}-sequencing analysis of 166,242 cells isolated from 21 individual organoids, finding that 95\% of the organoids generate a virtually indistinguishable compendium of cell types, following similar developmental trajectories and with a degree of organoid-to-organoid variability comparable to that of individual endogenous brains. Furthermore, organoids derived from different stem cell lines show consistent reproducibility in the cell types produced. The data demonstrate that reproducible development of the complex cellular diversity of the central nervous system does not require the context of the embryo, and that establishment of terminal cell identity is a highly constrained process that can emerge from diverse stem cell origins and growth environments.},

We performed {RNA}-seq in hippocampi and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices ({DLPFCs}) from 551 individuals (286 with schizophrenia). We identified substantial regional differences in gene expression and found widespread developmental differences that were independent of cellular composition. We identified 48 and 245 differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}) associated with schizophrenia within the hippocampus and {DLPFC}, with little overlap between the brain regions. 124 of 163 (76.6\%) of schizophrenia {GWAS} risk loci contained {eQTLs} in any region. Transcriptome-wide association studies in each region identified many novel schizophrenia risk features that were brain region-specific. Last, we identified potential molecular correlates of in vivo evidence of altered prefrontal-hippocampal functional coherence in schizophrenia. These results underscore the complexity and regional heterogeneity of the transcriptional correlates of schizophrenia and offer new insights into potentially causative biology.

We used extensive, empirically driven simulations to explore {eQTL} study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with {eQTLs} ({eGenes}) were substantially inflated when false discovery rate ({FDR}) control was applied to all tests and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inflated {FDR} for {eGenes} whose causal {SNPs} had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency {\textbackslash}textless 10\% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency {eQTL} {SNPs} ({eSNPs}) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with ≥80\% power, the top {eSNP} was the true simulated {eSNP} 90\% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common {eSNPs} (minor allele frequencies {\textbackslash}textgreater25\%). Overestimation of {eQTL} effect sizes, so-called 'Winner's Curse', was common in low and moderate power settings. To address this, we developed a bootstrap method ({BootstrapQTL}) that led to more accurate effect size estimation. These insights provide a foundation for future {eQTL} studies, especially those with sampling constraints and subtly different conditions.},

The promise of this technology is attracting a growing user base for single-cell analysis methods. As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an up-to-date workflow to analyse one's data. Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell {RNA}-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice. Our documented case study can be found at https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial This review will serve as a workflow tutorial for new entrants into the field, and help established users update their analysis pipelines. {\textbackslash}copyright 2019 The Authors.

Our understanding of the genetic determinants of disease risk has greatly advanced with the advent of genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}), which detect associations between genetic variants and complex traits or diseases by comparing populations of cases and controls. However, much of this discovery has occurred through {GWAS} of individuals of European ancestry, with limited representation of other populations, including from Africa, The Americas, Asia and Oceania. Population demography, genetic drift and adaptation to environments over thousands of years have led globally to the diversification of populations. This global genomic diversity can provide new opportunities for discovery and translation into therapies, as well as a better understanding of population disease risk. Large-scale multi-ethnic and representative biobanks and population health resources provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the genetic determinants of disease on a global scale.},

Utilizing these techniques and a novel lentiviral reporter for serotonergic neurons, we identified and overexpressed key transcription factors to successfully generate human serotonergic neurons. We found that overexpressing the transcription factors {NKX}2.2, {FEV}, {GATA}2 and {LMX}1B in combination with {ASCL}1 and {NGN}2 directly and efficiently generated serotonergic neurons from human fibroblasts.

Its development relies on a series of steps including neural progenitor cell proliferation, neuronal migration, axonal outgrowth and brain wiring. Disruption of these steps leads to cortical malformations, often associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy. We have generated a new resource to shed further light on subcortical heterotopia, a malformation characterized by abnormal neuronal position. We describe here the generation and characterization of a knockout ({KO}) mouse model for Eml1, a microtubule-associated protein showing mutations in human ribbon-like subcortical heterotopia. As previously reported for a spontaneous mouse mutant showing a mutation in Eml1, we observe severe cortical heterotopia in the {KO}. We also observe abnormal progenitor cells in early corticogenesis, likely to be the origin of the defects. {EML}1 {KO} mice on the C57BL/6N genetic background also appear to present a wider phenotype than the original mouse mutant, showing additional brain anomalies, such as corpus callosum abnormalities. We compare the anatomy of male and female mice and also study heterozygote animals. This new resource will help unravel roles for Eml1 in brain development and tissue architecture, as well as the mechanisms leading to severe subcortical heterotopia. {\textbackslash}copyright 2019 Anatomical Society.},

Such profiles can be aligned with genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) to implicate cell type specificity of the traits. Current methods typically rely only on a small subset of available {scRNA}-seq datasets, and integrating multiple datasets is hampered by complex batch effects. Here we collated 43 publicly available {scRNA}-seq datasets. We propose a 3-step workflow with conditional analyses within and between datasets, circumventing batch effects, to uncover associations of traits with cell types. Applying this method to 26 traits, we identify independent associations of multiple cell types. These results lead to starting points for follow-up functional studies aimed at gaining a mechanistic understanding of these traits. The proposed framework as well as the curated {scRNA}-seq datasets are made available via an online platform, {FUMA}, to facilitate rapid evaluation of cell type specificity by other researchers.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Different regions in a genome evolve at different rates depending on structural and functional constraints. Some genomic regions are highly conserved during metazoan evolution, while other regions may evolve rapidly, either in all species or in a lineage-specific manner. A strong or even moderate change in constraints in functional regions, for example in coding regions, can have significant evolutionary consequences. {RESULTS}: Here we discuss a novel framework, '{BaseDiver}', to classify groups of genes in humans based on the patterns of evolutionary constraints on polymorphic positions in their coding regions. Comparing the nucleotide-level divergence among mammals with the extent of deviation from the ancestral base in the human lineage, we identify patterns of evolutionary pressure on nonsynonymous base-positions in groups of genes belonging to the same functional category. Focussing on groups of genes in functional categories, we find that transcription factors contain a significant excess of nonsynonymous base-positions that are conserved in other mammals but changed in human, while immunity related genes harbour mutations at base-positions that evolve rapidly in all mammals including humans due to strong preference for advantageous alleles. Genes involved in olfaction also evolve rapidly in all mammals, and in humans this appears to be due to weak negative selection. {CONCLUSION}: While recent studies have identified genes under positive selection in humans, our approach identifies evolutionary constraints on Gene Ontology groups identifying changes in humans relative to some of the other mammals.},

	abstract = {The {ApoE} {\textbackslash}varepsilon4 allele is the most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease. The risk conferred by {\textbackslash}varepsilon4, however, differs across populations, with populations of African ancestry showing lower {\textbackslash}varepsilon4 risk compared to those of European or Asian ancestry. The cause of this heterogeneity in risk effect is currently unknown; it may be due to environmental or cultural factors correlated with ancestry, or it may be due to genetic variation local to the {ApoE} region that differs among populations. Exploring these hypotheses may lead to novel, population-specific therapeutics and risk predictions. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed {ApoE} genotypes and genome-wide array data in individuals from African American and Puerto Rican populations. A total of 1,766 African American and 220 Puerto Rican individuals with late-onset Alzheimer disease, and 3,730 African American and 169 Puerto Rican cognitively healthy individuals ({\textbackslash}textgreater 65 years) participated in the study. We first assessed average ancestry across the genome ("global" ancestry) and then tested it for interaction with {ApoE} genotypes. Next, we assessed the ancestral background of {ApoE} alleles ("local" ancestry) and tested if ancestry local to {ApoE} influenced Alzheimer disease risk while controlling for global ancestry. Measures of global ancestry showed no interaction with {ApoE} risk (Puerto Rican: p-value = 0.49; African American: p-value = 0.65). Conversely, ancestry local to the {ApoE} region showed an interaction with the {ApoE} {\textbackslash}varepsilon4 allele in both populations (Puerto Rican: p-value = 0.019; African American: p-value = 0.005). {ApoE} {\textbackslash}varepsilon4 alleles on an African background conferred a lower risk than those with a European ancestral background, regardless of population (Puerto Rican: {OR} = 1.26 on African background, {OR} = 4.49 on European; African American: {OR} = 2.34 on African background, {OR} = 3.05 on European background). Factors contributing to the lower risk effect in the {ApoE} gene {\textbackslash}varepsilon4 allele are likely due to ancestry-specific genetic factors near {ApoE} rather than non-genetic ethnic, cultural, and environmental factors.},

They are usually silenced by epigenetic mechanisms, but a few are known to escape silencing at embryonic stages, affecting early human development by regulating nearby protein-coding genes. To investigate transcriptional activity in human adult tissues we systematically investigate the expression landscape of about 4.2 million non-coding {TEs} in 8,051 {RNA}-Seq datasets from up to 49 adult tissues and 540 individuals. We show that approximately 79,558 individual {TEs} (2\%). belonging to 856 subfamilies escape epigenetic silencing in adult tissues and become transcriptionally active, often in a very tissue-specific manner. Supporting a role for {TEs} in the regulation of expression of nearby genes, we found the expression of {TEs} often correlated with the expression of nearby genes, and significantly stronger when the {TEs} include {eQTLs} for the genes. We identified thousands of tissue-elevated, sex-associated {TEs} in the breast, ethnicity-associated in the skin and age-associated in the tibial artery, where we found a potential implication of two {TE} subfamilies in atherosclerosis. Our results suggest a functional role of {TEs} in the regulation of gene expression, support their implication in human phenotypes, and also serve as a comprehensive resource of transcriptionally active {TEs} in human adult tissues.},

In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of modern imputation methods on the basis of the publicly available {POPRES} samples. Good quality genotypes were masked and re-imputed by different imputation frameworks: namely {MaCH}, {IMPUTE}2, {MaCH}-Minimac, {SHAPEIT}-{IMPUTE}2 and {MaCH}-Admix. Results were compared to evaluate the relative merit of pre-phasing and the usage of admixed references. We showed that the pre-phasing framework {SHAPEIT}-{IMPUTE}2 can overestimate the certainty of genotype distributions resulting in the lowest percentage of correctly imputed genotypes in our case. {MaCH}-Minimac performed better than {SHAPEIT}-{IMPUTE}2. Pre-phasing always reduced imputation accuracy. {IMPUTE}2 and {MaCH}-Admix, both relying on admixed-reference panels, showed comparable results. {MaCH} showed superior results if well-matched references were available (Nei's {GST} ≤ 0.010). For small to medium datasets, frameworks using genetically closest reference panel are recommended if the genetic distance between target and reference data set is small. Our results are valid for small to medium data sets. As shown on a larger data set of population based German samples, the disadvantage of pre-phasing decreases for larger sample sizes.},

Standard approaches to {GWAS}, however, are usually based on univariate hypothesis tests and therefore can account neither for correlations due to linkage disequilibrium nor for combinations of several markers. To discover and leverage such potential multivariate interactions, we propose in this work an extension of the Random Forest algorithm tailored for structured {GWAS} data. In terms of risk prediction, we show empirically on several {GWAS} datasets that the proposed T-Trees method significantly outperforms both the original Random Forest algorithm and standard linear models, thereby suggesting the actual existence of multivariate non-linear effects due to the combinations of several {SNPs}. We also demonstrate that variable importances as derived from our method can help identify relevant loci. Finally, we highlight the strong impact that quality control procedures may have, both in terms of predictive power and loci identification.

Two popular paradigms here are canonical correlation analysis ({CCA})-based approaches and autoencoder ({AE})-based approaches. {CCA}-based approaches learn a joint representation by maximizing correlation of the views when projected to the common subspace. {AE}-based methods learn a common representation by minimizing the error of reconstructing the two views. Each of these approaches has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, while {CCA}-based approaches outperform {AE}-based approaches for the task of transfer learning, they are not as scalable as the latter. In this work, we propose an {AE}-based approach, correlational neural network ({CorrNet}), that explicitly maximizes correlation among the views when projected to the common subspace. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed {CorrNet} is better than {AE} and {CCA} with respect to its ability to learn correlated common representations. We employ {CorrNet} for several cross-language tasks and show that the representations learned using it perform better than the ones learned using other state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Astroglia are the homoeostatic cells of the central nervous system that control a normal function of synaptically connected neuronal networks and contribute to brain defense. Recent advances in comprehension of pathological potential of astroglia indicate that astrocytes are fundamental for most (if not all) neurological diseases. Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies demonstrate prominent astroglial atrophy and astroglial asthenia occurring in most of neuropsychiatric illnesses. In chronic diseases such as schizophrenia and major depression, decrease in astroglial numbers and functional capabilities are, arguably, fundamental for pathological developments being responsible for neurotransmitter disbalance and failures in connectivity within neural networks. In neurodegenerative diseases atrophic changes in astrocytes are complemented by astrogliosis triggered by specific lesions such as senile plaques or dying neurons, these two processes contributing to cognitive decline and ultimately neuronal death. It is therefore possible to hypothesize that neuropsychiatric diseases represent a chronic astrogliopathology, which compromises glial homeostatic and defensive capabilities, and the degree and the alacrity of gliodegenerative changes define the progression and outcome of these disorders. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2013.},

Most initial {GWASs} have focused on genetically homogeneous cohorts from European populations given the limited availability of ethnic minority samples and so as to limit population stratification effects. Transethnic studies have been invaluable in explaining the heritability of common quantitative traits, such as height, and in examining the genetic architecture of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. They provide an opportunity for large-scale signal replication in independent populations and for cross-population meta-analyses to boost statistical power. In addition, transethnic {GWASs} enable prioritization of candidate genes, fine-mapping of functional variants, and potentially identification of {SNPs} associated with disease risk in admixed populations, by taking advantage of natural differences in genomic linkage disequilibrium across ethnically diverse populations. Recent efforts to assess the biological function of variants identified by {GWAS} have highlighted the need for large-scale replication, meta-analyses and fine-mapping across worldwide populations of ethnically diverse genetic ancestries. Here, we review recent advances and new approaches that are important to consider when performing, designing or interpreting transethnic {GWASs}, and we highlight existing challenges, such as the limited ability to handle heterogeneity in linkage disequilibrium across populations and limitations in dissecting complex architectures, such as those found in recently admixed populations.},

Recently, immunopathogenesis has emerged as one of the most compelling etiological models of schizophrenia. Over the past few years considerable research has been devoted to the role of innate immune responses in schizophrenia. The findings of such studies have helped to conceptualize schizophrenia as a chronic low-grade inflammatory disorder. Although the contribution of adaptive immune responses has also been emphasized, however, the precise role of T cells in the underlying neurobiological pathways of schizophrenia is yet to be ascertained comprehensively. T cells have the ability to infiltrate brain and mediate neuro-immune cross-talk. Conversely, the central nervous system and the neurotransmitters are capable of regulating the immune system. Neurotransmitter like dopamine, implicated widely in schizophrenia risk and progression can modulate the proliferation, trafficking and functions of T cells. Within brain, T cells activate microglia, induce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as reactive oxygen species and subsequently lead to neuroinflammation. Importantly, such processes contribute to neuronal injury/death and are gradually being implicated as mediators of neuroprogressive changes in schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs, commonly used to treat schizophrenia are also known to affect adaptive immune system; interfere with the differentiation and functions of T cells. This understanding suggests a pivotal role of T cells in the etiology, course and treatment of schizophrenia and forms the basis of this review.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic models of adaptive immune repertoire sequence distributions can be used to infer the expansion of immune cells in response to stimulus, differentiate genetic from environmental factors that determine repertoire sharing, and evaluate the suitability of various target immune sequences for stimulation via vaccination. Classically, these models are defined in terms of a probabilistic V(D)J recombination model which is sometimes combined with a selection model. In this paper we take a different approach, fitting variational autoencoder ({VAE}) models parameterized by deep neural networks to T cell receptor ({TCR}) repertoires. We show that simple {VAE} models can perform accurate cohort frequency estimation, learn the rules of {VDJ} recombination, and generalize well to unseen sequences. Further, we demonstrate that {VAE}-like models can distinguish between real sequences and sequences generated according to a recombination-selection model, and that many characteristics of {VAE}-generated sequences are similar to those of real sequences. {\textbackslash}copyright 2019, Davidsen et al.},

	abstract = {Glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor ({GDNF}), neurturin and persephin are neurotrophic factors involved in neuroneal differentiation, development and maintenance. They act on different types of neuroneal cells and signal through a receptor complex composed of a specific ligand-binding subunit of the {GDNF} family receptor alpha ({GFRalpha}) family together with a common signaling partner, the {cRET} protein tyrosine kinase. We describe the molecular cloning, expression, chromosomal localization and functional characterization of enovin, a fourth {GDNF} family member almost identical to the recently described artemin. We show the occurence in most tissues of several differently spliced {mRNA} variants for enovin, of which only two are able to translate into functional enovin protein. Some tissues seem to express only nonfunctional transcripts. These observations may underlie a complex transcriptional regulation pattern. Enovin {mRNA} expression is detectable in all adult and fetal human tissues examined, but expression levels are highest in peripheral tissues including prostate, placenta, pancreas, heart and kidney. This tissue distribution pattern is in accordance with that of {GFRalpha}-3, which here is shown to be the preferred ligand-binding receptor for enovin (Kd = 3.1 {nM}). The human enovin gene is localized on chromosome 1, region p31.3-p32. In vitro, enovin stimulates neurite outgrowth and counteracts taxol-induced neurotoxicity in staurosporine-differentiated {SH}-{SY}5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The peripheral expression pattern of enovin and its receptor together with its effects on neuroneal cells suggest that enovin might be useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in general and peripheral neuropathies in particular.},

By integrating {CRISPR}-mediated gene editing, activation and repression technologies to study one putative {SZ} {eQTL} ({FURIN} rs4702) and four top-ranked {SZ} {eQTL} genes ({FURIN}, {SNAP}91, {TSNARE}1 and {CLCN}3), our platform resolves pre- and postsynaptic neuronal deficits, recapitulates genotype-dependent gene expression differences and identifies convergence downstream of {SZ} {eQTL} gene perturbations. Our observations highlight the cell-type-specific effects of common variants and demonstrate a synergistic effect between {SZ} {eQTL} genes that converges on synaptic function.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {DNA} methylation ({DNAm}) is a critical regulator of both development and cellular identity and shows unique patterns in neurons. To better characterize maturational changes in {DNAm} patterns in these cells, we profile the {DNAm} landscape at single-base resolution across the first two decades of human neocortical development in {NeuN}+ neurons using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and compare them to non-neurons (primarily glia) and prenatal homogenate cortex. {RESULTS}: We show that {DNAm} changes more dramatically during the first 5 years of postnatal life than during the entire remaining period. We further refine global patterns of increasingly divergent neuronal {CpG} and {CpH} methylation ({mCpG} and {mCpH}) into six developmental trajectories and find that in contrast to genome-wide patterns, neighboring {mCpG} and {mCpH} levels within these regions are highly correlated. We integrate paired {RNA}-seq data and identify putative regulation of hundreds of transcripts and their splicing events exclusively by {mCpH} levels, independently from {mCpG} levels, across this period. We finally explore the relationship between {DNAm} patterns and development of brain-related phenotypes and find enriched heritability for many phenotypes within identified {DNAm} features. {CONCLUSIONS}: By profiling {DNAm} changes in {NeuN}-sorted neurons over the span of human cortical development, we identify novel, dynamic regions of {DNAm} that would be masked in homogenate {DNAm} data; expand on the relationship between {CpG} methylation, {CpH} methylation, and gene expression; and find enrichment particularly for neuropsychiatric diseases in genomic regions with cell type-specific, developmentally dynamic {DNAm} patterns.},

Here, we have investigated the link between {TNF}{\textbackslash}alpha reverse signalling and axon growth in cultured sympathetic neurons. {TNFR}1-activated {TNF}{\textbackslash}alpha reverse signalling promotes Ca2+ influx, and highly selective T-type Ca2+ channel inhibitors, but not pharmacological inhibitors of L-type, N-type and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, prevented enhanced axon growth. T-type Ca2+ channel-specific inhibitors eliminated Ca2+ spikes promoted by {TNF}{\textbackslash}alpha reverse signalling in axons and prevented enhanced axon growth when applied locally to axons, but not when applied to cell somata. Blocking action potential generation did not affect the effect of {TNF}{\textbackslash}alpha reverse signalling on axon growth, suggesting that propagated action potentials are not required for enhanced axon growth. {TNF}{\textbackslash}alpha reverse signalling enhanced protein kinase C ({PKC}) activation, and pharmacological inhibition of {PKC} prevented the axon growth response. These results suggest that {TNF}{\textbackslash}alpha reverse signalling promotes opening of T-type Ca2+ channels along sympathetic axons, which is required for enhanced axon growth. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 The Authors.},

Classification of a pairwise alignment of two sequences into positive and negative classes corresponds to the clustering of the input sequences. After we combined the distributed representation of {RNA} nucleotides with the secondary-structure information specific to {ncRNAs} and furthermore with mapping profiles of next-generation sequence reads, the training of {CNNs} for classification of alignments of {RNA} sequences yielded accurate clustering in terms of {ncRNA} families and outperformed the existing clustering methods for {ncRNA} sequences.

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetics is crucial to lasting changes in gene expression in the brain. Recent studies suggest a role for {DNA} methylation in {ADHD}. We explored the contribution to {ADHD} of allele-specific methylation ({ASM}), an epigenetic mechanism that involves {SNPs} correlating with differential levels of {DNA} methylation at {CpG} sites. We selected 3896 {tagSNPs} reported to influence methylation in human brain regions and performed a case-control association study using the summary statistics from the largest {GWAS} meta-analysis of {ADHD}, comprising 20,183 cases and 35,191 controls. We observed that genetic risk variants for {ADHD} are enriched in {ASM} {SNPs} and identified associations with eight {tagSNPs} that were significant at a 5\% false discovery rate ({FDR}). These {SNPs} correlated with methylation of {CpG} sites lying in the promoter regions of six genes. Since methylation may affect gene expression, we inspected these {ASM} {SNPs} together with 52 {ASM} {SNPs} in high {LD} with them for {eQTLs} in brain tissues and observed that the expression of three of those genes was affected by them. {ADHD} risk alleles correlated with increased expression (and decreased methylation) of {ARTN} and {PIDD}1 and with a decreased expression (and increased methylation) of C2orf82. Furthermore, these three genes were predicted to have altered expression in {ADHD}, and genetic variants in C2orf82 correlated with brain volumes. In summary, we followed a systematic approach to identify risk variants for {ADHD} that correlated with differential cis-methylation, identifying three novel genes contributing to the disorder.},

Mice carrying a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the orthologous gene exhibit alterations in axonal branching and cortical synaptic dynamics accompanied by working memory deficits. We show that Setd1a binds both promoters and enhancers with a striking overlap between Setd1a and Mef2 on enhancers. Setd1a targets are highly expressed in pyramidal neurons and display a complex pattern of transcriptional up- and downregulations shaped by presumed opposing functions of Setd1a on promoters and Mef2-bound enhancers. Notably, evolutionarily conserved Setd1a targets are associated with neuropsychiatric genetic risk burden. Reinstating Setd1a expression in adulthood rescues cognitive deficits. Finally, we identify {LSD}1 as a major counteracting demethylase for Setd1a and show that its pharmacological antagonism results in a full rescue of the behavioral and morphological deficits in Setd1a-deficient mice.

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a common, chronic and debilitating neuropsychiatric syndrome affecting tens of millions of individuals worldwide. While rare genetic variants play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia, most of the currently explained liability is within common variation, suggesting that variation predating the human diaspora out of Africa harbors a large fraction of the common variant attributable heritability. However, common variant association studies in schizophrenia have concentrated mainly on cohorts of European descent. We describe genome-wide association studies of 6152 cases and 3918 controls of admixed African ancestry, and of 1234 cases and 3090 controls of Latino ancestry, representing the largest such study in these populations to date. Combining results from the samples with African ancestry with summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium ({PGC}) study of schizophrenia yielded seven newly genome-wide significant loci, and we identified an additional eight loci by incorporating the results from samples with Latino ancestry. Leveraging population differences in patterns of linkage disequilibrium, we achieve improved fine-mapping resolution at 22 previously reported and 4 newly significant loci. Polygenic risk score profiling revealed improved prediction based on trans-ancestry meta-analysis results for admixed African (Nagelkerke's R2 = 0.032; liability R2 = 0.017; P {\textbackslash}textless 10-52), Latino (Nagelkerke's R2 = 0.089; liability R2 = 0.021; P {\textbackslash}textless 10-58), and European individuals (Nagelkerke's R2 = 0.089; liability R2 = 0.037; P {\textbackslash}textless 10-113), further highlighting the advantages of incorporating data from diverse human populations.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Despite their widespread use, the biological mechanisms underlying the efficacy of psychotropic drugs are still incompletely known; improved understanding of these is essential for development of novel more effective drugs and rational design of therapy. Given the large number of psychotropic drugs available and their differential pharmacological effects, it would be important to establish specific predictors of response to various classes of drugs. {RESULTS}: To identify the molecular mechanisms that may initiate therapeutic effects, whole-genome expression profiling (using 324 Illumina Mouse {WG}-6 microarrays) of drug-induced alterations in the mouse brain was undertaken, with a focus on the time-course (1, 2, 4 and 8 h) of gene expression changes produced by eighteen major psychotropic drugs: antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, psychostimulants and opioids. The resulting database is freely accessible at http://www.genes2mind.org. Bioinformatics approaches led to the identification of three main drug-responsive genomic networks and indicated neurobiological pathways that mediate the alterations in transcription. Each tested psychotropic drug was characterized by a unique gene network expression profile related to its neuropharmacological properties. Functional links that connect expression of the networks to the development of neuronal adaptations ({MAPK} signaling pathway), control of brain metabolism (adipocytokine pathway), and organization of cell projections ({mTOR} pathway) were found. {CONCLUSIONS}: The comparison of gene expression alterations between various drugs opened a new means to classify the different psychoactive compounds and to predict their cellular targets; this is well exemplified in the case of tianeptine, an antidepressant with unknown mechanisms of action. This work represents the first proof-of-concept study of a molecular classification of psychoactive drugs.},

	abstract = {Cancers converge onto shared patterns that arise from constraints placed by the biology of the originating cell lineage and microenvironment on programs driven by oncogenic events. Here we define consistent expression modules reflecting this structure in colon and breast cancer by exploiting expression data resources and a new computationally efficient approach that we validate against other comparable methods. This approach, Parsimonious Gene Correlation Network Analysis ({PGCNA}), allows comparison of network structures between these cancer types identifying shared modules of gene co-expression reflecting: cancer hallmarks, functional and structural gene batteries, copy number variation and biology of originating lineage. These networks along with the mapping of outcome data at gene and module level provide an interactive resource that generates context for relationships between genes within and between such modules. Assigning module expression values ({MEVs}) provides a tool to summarize network level gene expression in individual cases illustrating potential utility in classification and allowing analysis of linkage between module expression and mutational state. Exploiting {TCGA} data thus defines both recurrent patterns of association between module expression and mutation at data-set level, and exemplifies the polarization of mutation patterns with the leading edge of module expression at individual case level. We illustrate the scalable nature of the approach within immune response related modules, which in the context of breast cancer demonstrates the selective association of immune subsets, in particular mast cells, with the underlying mutational pattern. Together our analyses provide evidence for a generalizable framework to enhance molecular stratification in cancer.},

In a study of samples from apple canker in Shaanxi Province, China, diverse microbes, along with the necrotrophic pathogen Valsa mali, were found to colonize the apple bark, thus providing ample opportunity for {HGT} to occur. In the present study, we identified 32 {HGT} events in V. mali by combining phyletic distribution-based methods with phylogenetic analyses. Most of these {HGTs} were from bacteria, whereas several others were from eukaryotes. Three {HGTs} putatively functioned in competition with actinomycetes, some of which showed a significant inhibitory effect on V. mali. Three {HGTs} that were probably involved in nitrogen uptake were also identified. Ten {HGTs} were thought to be involved in pathogenicity because they were related to known virulence factors, including cell wall-degrading enzymes and candidate effector proteins. {HGT}14, together with {HGT}32, was shown to contribute to bleomycin resistance of V. mali.These results suggest that {HGT} drives the adaptive evolution of V. mali. The {HGTs} identified here provide new clues for unveiling the adaptation mechanisms and virulence determinants of V. mali.},

	abstract = {Chronic pain is a major therapeutic problem as the current treatment options are unsatisfactory with low efficacy and deleterious side effects. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels ({VGCCs}), which are multi-complex proteins consisting of {\textbackslash}alpha1, {\textbackslash}beta, {\textbackslash}gamma, and {\textbackslash}alpha2{\textbackslash}delta subunits, play an important role in pain signaling. These channels are involved in neurogenic inflammation, excitability, and neurotransmitter release in nociceptors. It has been previously shown that N-type {VGCCs} (Cav2.2) are a major pain target. U.S. {FDA} approval of three Cav2.2 antagonists, gabapentin, pregabalin, and ziconotide, for chronic pain underlies the importance of this channel subtype. Also, there has been increasing evidence that L-type (Cav1.2) or T-type (Cav3.2) {VGCCs} may be involved in pain signaling and chronic pain. In order to develop novel pain therapeutics and to understand the role of {VGCC} subtypes, discovering subtype selective {VGCC} inhibitors or methods that selectively target the inhibitor into nociceptors would be essential. This review describes the various {VGCC} subtype inhibitors and the potential of utilizing {VGCC} subtypes as targets of chronic pain. Development of {VGCC} subtype inhibitors and targeting them into nociceptors will contribute to a better understanding of the roles of {VGCC} subtypes in pain at a spinal level as well as development of a novel class of analgesics for chronic pain.},

Furthermore, we collect networks from multiple experimental single-cell {RNA}-seq datasets. We develop an evaluation framework called {BEELINE}. We find that the area under the precision-recall curve and early precision of the algorithms are moderate. The methods are better in recovering interactions in synthetic networks than Boolean models. The algorithms with the best early precision values for Boolean models also perform well on experimental datasets. Techniques that do not require pseudotime-ordered cells are generally more accurate.

First, we performed mass cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and discovered an immune signature of Alzheimer's disease that consists of increased numbers of {CD}8+ T effector memory {CD}45RA+ ({TEMRA}) cells. In a second cohort, we found that {CD}8+ {TEMRA} cells were negatively associated with cognition.

Notably, by using several strategies of single-cell {TCR} sequencing in a third cohort, we discovered clonally expanded {CD}8+ {TEMRA} cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we used machine learning, cloning and peptide screens to demonstrate the specificity of clonally expanded {TCRs} in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease to two separate Epstein-Barr virus antigens.

Mice were exposed to {LPS}, expression of Sirt3, {HIF}-2{\textbackslash}alpha, Notch3 and angiopoietins/Tie-2, pericyte/endothelial ({EC}) coverage and vascular permeability were assessed. Mice treated with {LPS} significantly reduced the expression of {SIRT}3, {HIF}-2{\textbackslash}alpha and Notch3 in the lung. Furthermore, exposure to {LPS} increased Ang-2 while inhibited Ang-1/Tie-2 expression with a reduced pericyte/{EC} coverage. Intriguingly, knockout of Sirt3 upregulated Ang-2, but downregulated Tie-2 and {HIF}-2{\textbackslash}alpha/Notch3 expression which resulted in a dramatic reduction of pericyte/{EC} coverage and exacerbation of {LPS}-induced vascular leakage. Conversely, overexpression of Sirt3 reduced Ang-2 expression and increased Ang-1/Tie-2 and {HIF}-2{\textbackslash}alpha/Notch3 expression in the {LPS} treated mice. Overexpression of Sirt3 further prevented {LPS}-induced pericyte loss and vascular leakage. This was accompanied by a significant reduction of the mortality rate.

Multiomic data have uncovered transcriptional regulatory networks of the dentate gyrus marker {PROX}1.

Individuals with schizophrenia were significantly more likely than controls to harbor private, severely damaging mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic function, including neural circuitry mediated by the neurotransmitters glutamine, {\textbackslash}gamma-aminobutyric acid, and dopamine. Schizophrenia is genetically highly heterogeneous, involving severe ultrarare mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic plasticity. The depth of genetic variation in Africa revealed this relationship with a moderate sample size and informed our understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia worldwide.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) in Parkinson's disease have increased the scope of biological knowledge about the disease over the past decade. We aimed to use the largest aggregate of {GWAS} data to identify novel risk loci and gain further insight into the causes of Parkinson's disease. {METHODS}: We did a meta-analysis of 17 datasets from Parkinson's disease {GWAS} available from European ancestry samples to nominate novel loci for disease risk. These datasets incorporated all available data. We then used these data to estimate heritable risk and develop predictive models of this heritability. We also used large gene expression and methylation resources to examine possible functional consequences as well as tissue, cell type, and biological pathway enrichments for the identified risk factors. Additionally, we examined shared genetic risk between Parkinson's disease and other phenotypes of interest via genetic correlations followed by Mendelian randomisation. {FINDINGS}: Between Oct 1, 2017, and Aug 9, 2018, we analysed 7·8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 37 688 cases, 18 618 {UK} Biobank proxy-cases (ie, individuals who do not have Parkinson's disease but have a first degree relative that does), and 1·4 million controls. We identified 90 independent genome-wide significant risk signals across 78 genomic regions, including 38 novel independent risk signals in 37 loci. These 90 variants explained 16-36\% of the heritable risk of Parkinson's disease depending on prevalence. Integrating methylation and expression data within a Mendelian randomisation framework identified putatively associated genes at 70 risk signals underlying {GWAS} loci for follow-up functional studies. Tissue-specific expression enrichment analyses suggested Parkinson's disease loci were heavily brain-enriched, with specific neuronal cell types being implicated from single cell data. We found significant genetic correlations with brain volumes (false discovery rate-adjusted p=0·0035 for intracranial volume, p=0·024 for putamen volume), smoking status (p=0·024), and educational attainment (p=0·038). Mendelian randomisation between cognitive performance and Parkinson's disease risk showed a robust association (p=8·00 × 10-7). {INTERPRETATION}: These data provide the most comprehensive survey of genetic risk within Parkinson's disease to date, to the best of our knowledge, by revealing many additional Parkinson's disease risk loci, providing a biological context for these risk factors, and showing that a considerable genetic component of this disease remains unidentified. These associations derived from European ancestry datasets will need to be followed-up with more diverse data. {FUNDING}: The National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health ({USA}), The Michael J Fox Foundation, and The Parkinson's Foundation (see appendix for full list of funding sources).

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) identify genetic variants associated with traits or diseases. {GWAS} never directly link variants to regulatory mechanisms. Instead, the functional annotation of variants is typically inferred by post hoc analyses. A specific class of deep learning-based methods allows for the prediction of regulatory effects per variant on several cell type-specific chromatin features. We here describe "{DeepWAS}", a new approach that integrates these regulatory effect predictions of single variants into a multivariate {GWAS} setting. Thereby, single variants associated with a trait or disease are directly coupled to their impact on a chromatin feature in a cell type. Up to 61 regulatory {SNPs}, called {dSNPs}, were associated with multiple sclerosis ({MS}, 4,888 cases and 10,395 controls), major depressive disorder ({MDD}, 1,475 cases and 2,144 controls), and height (5,974 individuals). These variants were mainly non-coding and reached at least nominal significance in classical {GWAS}. The prediction accuracy was higher for {DeepWAS} than for classical {GWAS} models for 91\% of the genome-wide significant, {MS}-specific {dSNPs}. {DSNPs} were enriched in public or cohort-matched expression and methylation quantitative trait loci and we demonstrated the potential of {DeepWAS} to generate testable functional hypotheses based on genotype data alone. {DeepWAS} is available at https://github.com/cellmapslab/{DeepWAS}.},

In the past 30 years, the absolute numbers of deaths and people with disabilities owing to neurological diseases have risen substantially, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, and further increases are expected globally as a result of population growth and ageing. This rise in absolute numbers of people affected suggests that advances in prevention and management of major neurological disorders are not sufficiently effective to counter global demographic changes. Urgent measures to reduce this burden are therefore needed. Because resources for health care and research are already overstretched, priorities need to be set to guide policy makers, governments, and funding organisations to develop and implement action plans for prevention, health care, and research to tackle the growing challenge of neurological disorders.

We report novel evidence of a functionally meaningful structural tri-partition along the anterior-posterior axis of this region. The connectivity of the {CN} subregions is in line with connectivity evidence from earlier invasive studies in animal models. In addition, histological validation using polarized light imaging ({PLI}) confirms these results, corroborating the notion that cortico-subcortico-cortical loops involve microstructurally differentiated regions in the caudate nucleus.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To examine whether gene expression analysis of a large-scale Parkinson disease ({PD}) patient cohort produces a robust blood-based {PD} gene signature compared to previous studies that have used relatively small cohorts (≤220 samples). {METHODS}: Whole-blood gene expression profiles were collected from a total of 523 individuals. After preprocessing, the data contained 486 gene profiles (n = 205 {PD}, n = 233 controls, n = 48 other neurodegenerative diseases) that were partitioned into training, validation, and independent test cohorts to identify and validate a gene signature. Batch-effect reduction and cross-validation were performed to ensure signature reliability. Finally, functional and pathway enrichment analyses were applied to the signature to identify {PD}-associated gene networks. {RESULTS}: A gene signature of 100 probes that mapped to 87 genes, corresponding to 64 upregulated and 23 downregulated genes differentiating between patients with idiopathic {PD} and controls, was identified with the training cohort and successfully replicated in both an independent validation cohort (area under the curve [{AUC}] = 0.79, p = 7.13E-6) and a subsequent independent test cohort ({AUC} = 0.74, p = 4.2E-4). Network analysis of the signature revealed gene enrichment in pathways, including metabolism, oxidation, and ubiquitination/proteasomal activity, and misregulation of mitochondria-localized genes, including downregulation of {COX}4I1, {ATP}5A1, and {VDAC}3. {CONCLUSIONS}: We present a large-scale study of {PD} gene expression profiling.

The paucity of data on individuals with African ancestry is especially noteworthy as Africa is the birthplace of modern humans and harbors the greatest genetic diversity. It is expected that greater representation of those with African ancestry in genomic research will bring novel insights into human biology, and lead to improvements in clinical care and improved understanding of health disparities. Now that major efforts have been undertaken to address this failing, is there evidence of these anticipated advances? Here, we evaluate the promise of including diverse individuals in genomic research in the context of recent literature on individuals of African ancestry.

	abstract = {It is estimated that the impact of related genes on the risk of Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is nearly 70\%. Identifying candidate causal genes can help treatment and diagnosis. The maturity of sequencing technology and the reduction of cost make genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) become an important means to find disease-related mutation sites. Because of linkage disequilibrium ({LD}), neither the gene regulated by {SNP} nor the specific {SNP} can be determined. Because {GWAS} is affected by sample size and interaction, we introduced empirical Bayes ({EB}) to make a meta-analysis of {GWAS} to greatly eliminate the bias caused by sample and the interaction of {SNP}. In addition, most {SNPs} are in the noncoding region, so it is not clear how they relate to phenotype. In this paper, expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}) studies and methylation quantitative trait locus ({mQTL}) studies are combined with {GWAS} to find the genes associated with Alzheimer disease in expression levels by pleiotropy. Summary data-based Mendelian randomization ({SMR}) is introduced to integrate {GWAS} and {eQTL}/{mQTL} data. Finally, we prioritized 274 significant {SNPs}, which belong to 20 genes by {eQTL} analysis and 379 significant {SNPs}, which belong to seven known genes by {mQTL}. Among them, 93 {SNPs} and 2 genes are overlapped. Finally, we did 10 case studies to prove the effectiveness of our method. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2019 Zhao, Hu, Zang and Wang.},

	abstract = {Specific cell populations may have unique contributions to schizophrenia but may be missed in studies of homogenate tissue. Here laser capture microdissection followed by {RNA} sequencing ({LCM}-seq) was used to transcriptomically profile the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus ({DG}-{GCL}) in human hippocampus and contrast these data to those obtained from bulk hippocampal homogenate. We identified widespread cell-type-enriched aging and genetic effects in the {DG}-{GCL} that were either absent or directionally discordant in bulk hippocampus data. Of the ∼9 million expression quantitative trait loci identified in the {DG}-{GCL}, 15\% were not detected in bulk hippocampus, including 15 schizophrenia risk variants. We created transcriptome-wide association study genetic weights from the {DG}-{GCL}, which identified many schizophrenia-associated genetic signals not found in transcriptome-wide association studies from bulk hippocampus, including {GRM}3 and {CACNA}1C. These results highlight the improved biological resolution provided by targeted sampling strategies like {LCM} and complement homogenate and single-nucleus approaches in human brain.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Random forests ({RF}) have been increasingly used in applications such as genome-wide association and microarray studies where predictor correlation is frequently observed. Recent works on permutation-based variable importance measures ({VIMs}) used in {RF} have come to apparently contradictory conclusions. We present an extended simulation study to synthesize results. {RESULTS}: In the case when both predictor correlation was present and predictors were associated with the outcome ({HA}), the unconditional {RF} {VIM} attributed a higher share of importance to correlated predictors, while under the null hypothesis that no predictors are associated with the outcome (H0) the unconditional {RF} {VIM} was unbiased. Conditional {VIMs} showed a decrease in {VIM} values for correlated predictors versus the unconditional {VIMs} under {HA} and was unbiased under H0. Scaled {VIMs} were clearly biased under {HA} and H0. {CONCLUSIONS}: Unconditional unscaled {VIMs} are a computationally tractable choice for large datasets and are unbiased under the null hypothesis. Whether the observed increased {VIMs} for correlated predictors may be considered a "bias" - because they do not directly reflect the coefficients in the generating model - or if it is a beneficial attribute of these {VIMs} is dependent on the application. For example, in genetic association studies, where correlation between markers may help to localize the functionally relevant variant, the increased importance of correlated predictors may be an advantage. On the other hand, we show examples where this increased importance may result in spurious signals.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Although not typical of Parkinson's disease ({PD}), caudate dopaminergic dysfunction can occur in early stages of the disease. However, its frequency and longitudinal implications in large cohorts of recently diagnosed patients remain to be established. We investigated the occurrence of caudate dopaminergic dysfunction in the very early phases of {PD} ({\textbackslash}textless 2 years from diagnosis) using 123I-{FP}-{CIT} single photon emission {CT} and determined whether it was associated with the presence or subsequent development of cognitive impairment, depression, sleep and gait problems. {METHODS}: Patients with {PD} and healthy controls were identified from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative ({PPMI}) database. We defined a clinically significant caudate dysfunction as 123I-{FP}-{CIT} binding {\textbackslash}textless -2 {SDs} compared with the controls' mean and categorised three groups accordingly (no reduction, unilateral reduction, bilateral reduction). All statistical analyses were adjusted for mean putamen binding. {RESULTS}: At baseline, 51.6\% of 397 patients had normal caudate dopamine transporter binding, 26.0\% had unilateral caudate involvement, 22.4\% had bilaterally impaired caudate.Compared with those with a baseline normal caudate function, at the4-year follow-up patients with a baseline bilateral caudate involvement showed a higher frequency of cognitive impairment (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.001) and depression (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.001), and worse cognitive (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.001), depression ({\textbackslash}textless 0.05) and gait ({\textbackslash}textless 0.001) ratings. Significant caudate involvement was observed in 83.9\% of the population after 4 years (unilateral 22.5\%, bilateral 61.4\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: Early significant caudate dopaminergic denervation was found in half of the cases in the {PPMI} series. Baseline bilateral caudate involvement was associated with increased risk of developing cognitive impairment, depression and gait problems over the next 4 years. {\textbackslash}copyright Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Disability and disease severity measures were compared by race, income, and educational level using analysis of variance for continuous variables and {\textbackslash}chi(2) tests for dichotomous variables. {RESULTS}: The sample included 1159 patients with parkinsonism (93.4\% white, 6.1\% African American, 61.2\% who earned more than \$50,000 annually, 62.7\% who completed college, and 79.2\% with a diagnosis of Parkinson disease). Cross-sectional analyses by race, income, and educational level showed greater disability and disease severity in African American compared with white patients (African American vs white Older Americans Resources and Services subscale total score, 29.8 vs 25.3, P = .005; Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale total score, 53.0 vs 42.8; P {\textbackslash}textless .001). African Americans were less likely to be prescribed dopaminergic medications, particularly newer agents (African Americans 20.6\% vs whites: 41.1\%; P = .01). Lower income and lower educational level were independently associated with greater disease severity and disability (P {\textbackslash}textless .003). {CONCLUSION}: Racial and socioeconomic disparities exist among patients with parkinsonism being treated at a tertiary Movement Disorders Center. African Americans and those with lower socioeconomic status have greater disease severity and disability than whites. These disparities may be because of problems in diagnosis, access to care, physician referrals, and patient attitudes regarding the appropriate threshold for seeking treatment at a specialized center.

	abstract = {The distribution and abundance of immune cells, particularly T-cell subsets, play pivotal roles in cancer immunology and therapy. T cells have many subsets with specific function and current methods are limited in estimating them, thus, a method for predicting comprehensive T-cell subsets is urgently needed in cancer immunology research. Here, Immune Cell Abundance Identifier ({ImmuCellAI}), a gene set signature-based method, is introduced for precisely estimating the abundance of 24 immune cell types including 18 T-cell subsets, from gene expression data. Performance evaluation on both the sequencing data with flow cytometry results and public expression data indicate that {ImmuCellAI} can estimate the abundance of immune cells with superior accuracy to other methods especially on many T-cell subsets. Application of {ImmuCellAI} to immunotherapy datasets reveals that the abundance of dendritic cells, cytotoxic T, and gamma delta T cells is significantly higher both in comparisons of on-treatment versus pre-treatment and responders versus non-responders. Meanwhile, an {ImmuCellAI} result-based model is built for predicting the immunotherapy response with high accuracy (area under curve 0.80-0.91). These results demonstrate the powerful and unique function of {ImmuCellAI} in tumor immune infiltration estimation and immunotherapy response prediction. {\textbackslash}copyright 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in the striatum of Huntingon's Disease ({HD}) brain are currently unknown. While the striatum is massively degenerated in symptomatic individuals, which makes cellular characterization difficult, it is largely intact in asymptomatic {HD} gene positive ({HD}+) individuals. Unfortunately, as striatal tissue samples from {HD}+ individuals are exceedingly rare, recent focus has been on the Brodmann Area 9 ({BA}9), a relatively unaffected region, as a surrogate tissue. In this study, we analyze gene expression in caudate nucleus ({CAU}) from two {HD}+ individuals and compare the results with healthy and symptomatic {HD} brains. {METHODS}: High-throughput {mRNA} sequencing ({mRNA}-Seq) datasets were generated from post-mortem {CAU} of 2 asymptomatic {HD}+ individuals and compared with 26 {HD} and 56 neurologically normal controls. Datasets were analyzed using a custom bioinformatic analysis pipeline to identify and interpret differentially expressed ({DE}) genes. Results were compared to publicly available brain {mRNA}-Seq datasets from the Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) project. The analysis employed current state of the art bioinformatics tools and tailored statistical and machine learning methods. {RESULTS}: The transcriptional profiles in {HD}+ {CAU} and {HD} {BA}9 samples are highly similar. Differentially expressed ({DE}) genes related to the heat shock response, particularly {HSPA}6 and {HSPA}1A, are common between regions. The most perturbed pathways show extensive agreement when comparing disease with control. A random forest classifier predicts that the two {HD}+ {CAU} samples strongly resemble {HD} {BA}9 and not control {BA}9. Nonetheless, when genes were prioritized by their specificity to {HD}+ {CAU}, pathways spanning many biological processes emerge. Comparison of {HD}+ {BA}9 with {HD} {BA}9 identified {NPAS}4 and {REST}1/2 as potential early responders to disease and reflect the active disease process. {CONCLUSIONS}: The caudate nucleus in {HD} brain is dramatically affected prior to symptom onset. Gene expression patterns observed in the {HD} {BA}9 are also present in the {CAU}, suggesting a common response to disease. Substantial caudate-specific differences implicate many different biological pathways including metabolism, protein folding, inflammation, and neurogenic processes. While these results are at best trends due to small sample sizes, these results nonetheless provide the most detailed insight to date into the primary {HD} disease process.},

	abstract = {{DNA} micro-arrays now permit scientists to screen thousands of genes simultaneously and determine whether those genes are active, hyperactive or silent in normal or cancerous tissue. Because these new micro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues. In this paper, we address the problem of selection of a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data, recorded on {DNA} micro-arrays. Using available training examples from cancer and normal patients, we build a classifier suitable for genetic diagnosis, as well as drug discovery. Previous attempts to address this problem select genes with correlation techniques. We propose a new method of gene selection utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination ({RFE}). We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our techniques yield better classification performance and are biologically relevant to cancer. In contrast with the baseline method, our method eliminates gene redundancy automatically and yields better and more compact gene subsets. In patients with leukemia our method discovered 2 genes that yield zero leave-one-out error, while 64 genes are necessary for the baseline method to get the best result (one leave-one-out error). In the colon cancer database, using only 4 genes our method is 98\% accurate, while the baseline method is only 86\% accurate.},

We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with projecting excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Neurological diseases were associated with different cell types, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. Notably, Parkinson's disease was genetically associated not only with cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons (which include dopaminergic neurons) but also with enteric neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using post-mortem brain transcriptomic data, we confirmed alterations in these cells, even at the earliest stages of disease progression.

Importantly, compared to existing methods, our approach is extremely efficient, making it suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets that are becoming ubiquitous.

	abstract = {Many common illnesses, for reasons that have not been identified, differentially affect men and women. For instance, the autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus ({SLE}) and Sjögren's syndrome affect nine times more women than men1, whereas schizophrenia affects men with greater frequency and severity relative to women2. All three illnesses have their strongest common genetic associations in the major histocompatibility complex ({MHC}) locus, an association that in {SLE} and Sjögren's syndrome has long been thought to arise from alleles of the human leukocyte antigen ({HLA}) genes at that locus3-6. Here we show that variation of the complement component 4 (C4) genes C4A and C4B, which are also at the {MHC} locus and have been linked to increased risk for schizophrenia7, generates 7-fold variation in risk for {SLE} and 16-fold variation in risk for Sjögren's syndrome among individuals with common C4 genotypes, with C4A protecting more strongly than C4B in both illnesses. The same alleles that increase risk for schizophrenia greatly reduce risk for {SLE} and Sjögren's syndrome. In all three illnesses, C4 alleles act more strongly in men than in women: common combinations of C4A and C4B generated 14-fold variation in risk for {SLE}, 31-fold variation in risk for Sjögren's syndrome, and 1.7-fold variation in schizophrenia risk among men (versus 6-fold, 15-fold and 1.26-fold variation in risk among women, respectively). At a protein level, both C4 and its effector C3 were present at higher levels in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma8,9 in men than in women among adults aged between 20 and 50 years, corresponding to the ages of differential disease vulnerability. Sex differences in complement protein levels may help to explain the more potent effects of C4 alleles in men, women's greater risk of {SLE} and Sjögren's syndrome and men's greater vulnerability to schizophrenia. These results implicate the complement system as a source of sexual dimorphism in vulnerability to diverse illnesses.},

Ideal validation for such methods is application to simulated data, where some 'truth' is known. As {GWAS} increase in size, so does the computational complexity of such evaluations; standard practice repeatedly simulates and analyses genotype data for all individuals in an example study. {RESULTS}: We have developed a novel method based on an alternative approach, directly simulating {GWAS} summary data, without individual data as an intermediate step. We mathematically derive the expected statistics for any set of causal variants and their effect sizes, conditional upon control haplotype frequencies (available from public reference datasets). Simulation of {GWAS} summary output can be conducted independently of sample size by simulating random variates about these expected values. Across a range of scenarios, our method, produces very similar output to that from simulating individual genotypes with a substantial gain in speed even for modest sample sizes. Fast simulation of {GWAS} summary statistics will enable more complete and rapid evaluation of summary statistic methods as well as opening new potential avenues of research in fine mapping and gene set enrichment analysis. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Our method is available under a {GPL} license as an R package from http://github.com/chr1swallace/{simGWAS}. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {Inflammatory processes may contribute to risk for Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) and age-related brain degeneration. Metabolic and genetic risk factors, and physical activity may, in turn, influence these inflammatory processes. Some of these risk factors are modifiable, and interact with each other. Understanding how these processes together relate to brain aging will help to inform future interventions to treat or prevent cognitive decline. We used brain magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) to scan 335 older adult humans (mean age 77.3 ± 3.4 years) who remained non-demented for the duration of the 9-year longitudinal study. We used structural equation modeling ({SEM}) in a subset of 226 adults to evaluate whether measures of baseline peripheral inflammation (serum C-reactive protein levels; {CRP}), mediated the baseline contributions of genetic and metabolic risk, and physical activity, to regional cortical thickness in {AD}-relevant brain regions at study year 9. We found that both baseline metabolic risk and {AD} risk variant apolipoprotein E {\textbackslash}varepsilon4 ({APOE}4), modulated baseline serum {CRP}. Higher baseline {CRP} levels, in turn, predicted thinner regional cortex at year 9, and mediated an effect between higher metabolic risk and thinner cortex in those regions. A higher polygenic risk score composed of variants in immune-associated {AD} risk genes (other than {APOE}) was associated with thinner regional cortex. However, {CRP} levels did not mediate this effect, suggesting that other mechanisms may be responsible for the elevated {AD} risk. We found interactions between genetic and environmental factors and structural brain health. Our findings support the role of metabolic risk and peripheral inflammation in age-related brain decline.

	abstract = {Beyond being one the most widely used psychoactive drugs in the world, cannabis has been identified as an environmental risk factor for psychosis. Though the relationship between cannabis use and psychiatric disorders remains controversial, consistent association between early adolescent cannabis use and the subsequent risk of psychosis suggested adolescence may be a particularly vulnerable period. Previous findings on gene by environment interactions indicated that cannabis use may only increase the risk for psychosis in the subjects who have a specific genetic vulnerability. The type 1 cannabinoid receptor ({CB}1), encoded by the {CNR}1 gene, is a key component of the endocannabinoid system. As the primary endocannabinoid receptor in the brain, {CB}1 is the main molecular target of the endocannabinoid ligand, as well as tetrahydrocannabinol ({THC}), the principal psychoactive ingredient of cannabis. In this study, we have examined {mRNA} expression and {DNA} methylation of {CNR}1 in human prefrontal cortex ({PFC}), hippocampus, and caudate samples. The expression of {CNR}1 is higher in fetal {PFC} and hippocampus, then drops down dramatically after birth. The lifespan trajectory of {CNR}1 expression in the {DLPFC} differentially correlated with age by allelic variation at rs4680, a functional polymorphism in the {COMT} gene. Compared with {COMT} methionine158 carriers, Caucasian carriers of the {COMT} valine158 allele have a stronger negative correlation between the expression of {CNR}1 in {DLPFC} and age. In contrast, the methylation level of cg02498983, which is negatively correlated with the expression of {CNR}1 in {PFC}, showed the strongest positive correlation with age in {PFC} of Caucasian carriers of {COMT} valine158. Additionally, we have observed decreased {mRNA} expression of {CNR}1 in the {DLPFC} of patients with schizophrenia. Further analysis revealed a positive {eQTL} {SNP}, rs806368, which predicted the expression of a novel transcript of {CNR}1 in human {DLPFC}, hippocampus and caudate. This {SNP} has been associated with addiction and other psychiatric disorders. {THC} or ethanol are each significantly associated with dysregulated expression of {CNR}1 in the {PFC} of patients with affective disorder, and the expression of {CNR}1 is significantly upregulated in the {PFC} of schizophrenia patients who completed suicide. Our results support previous studies that have implicated the endocannabinoid system in the pathology of schizophrenia and provided additional insight into the mechanism of increasing risk for schizophrenia in the adolescent cannabis users.},

Using whole transcriptome data on lymphoblastoid cell lines from 338 samples of European origin, we tried to uncover genes differentially expressed between the two sexes and sex-interacting expression quantitative trait loci (ss-{eQTLs}). Two {miRNAs} were found to be differentially expressed between the two sexes, both of which were found to be functionally implicated in breast cancer. Using two stage linear regression analysis, 21 {mRNA} ss-{eQTL} and 3 {miRNA} ss-{eQTLs} were discovered. We replicated two of the {mRNA} ss-{eQTLs} (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.1) using a separate dataset of gene expression data derived from monocytes. Three {mRNA} ss-{eQTLs} are in high linkage disequilibrium with variants also found to be associated with sexually dimorphic traits.

Twenty-seven normal comparison subjects were matched within sex on the basis of age, parental socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and handedness. An extensive neuropsychological test battery was administered, and multivariate analysis of variance was used to test for the effects of sex and group and sex-by-group interactions. {RESULTS}: Male patients were significantly impaired across all functions in comparison with normal male subjects and on tests of attention, verbal memory, and executive functions in comparison with female patients. Female patients performed significantly worse than female normal comparison subjects only on tests of attention, executive functions, visual memory, and motor functions. {CONCLUSIONS}: The findings suggest that women with schizophrenia may be less vulnerable to particular cognitive deficits, especially those involving verbal processing, than schizophrenic men.},

While genotyping algorithms are largely concordant when assessed on {HapMap} samples, tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association. The R package crlmm implements a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides allele-specific estimates of copy number. This paper illustrates a workflow for the estimation of allele-specific copy number and integration of the marker-level estimates with complimentary Bioconductor software for inferring regions of copy number gain or loss. All analyses are performed in the statistical environment R.},

	abstract = {Submicroscopic changes in chromosomal {DNA} copy number dosage are common and have been implicated in many heritable diseases and cancers. Recent high-throughput technologies have a resolution that permits the detection of segmental changes in {DNA} copy number that span thousands of base pairs in the genome. Genomewide association studies ({GWAS}) may simultaneously screen for copy number phenotype and single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) phenotype associations as part of the analytic strategy. However, genomewide array analyses are particularly susceptible to batch effects as the logistics of preparing {DNA} and processing thousands of arrays often involves multiple laboratories and technicians, or changes over calendar time to the reagents and laboratory equipment. Failure to adjust for batch effects can lead to incorrect inference and requires inefficient post hoc quality control procedures to exclude regions that are associated with batch. Our work extends previous model-based approaches for copy number estimation by explicitly modeling batch and using shrinkage to improve locus-specific estimates of copy number uncertainty. Key features of this approach include the use of biallelic genotype calls from experimental data to estimate batch-specific and locus-specific parameters of background and signal without the requirement of training data. We illustrate these ideas using a study of bipolar disease and a study of chromosome 21 trisomy. The former has batch effects that dominate much of the observed variation in the quantile-normalized intensities, while the latter illustrates the robustness of our approach to a data set in which approximately 27\% of the samples have altered copy number. Locus-specific estimates of copy number can be plotted on the copy number scale to investigate mosaicism and guide the choice of appropriate downstream approaches for smoothing the copy number as a function of physical position. The software is open source and implemented in the R package crlmm at Bioconductor (http:www.bioconductor.org).},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) are used to discover genes underlying complex, heritable disorders for which less powerful study designs have failed in the past. The number of {GWAS} has skyrocketed recently with findings reported in top journals and the mainstream media. Microarrays are the genotype calling technology of choice in {GWAS} as they permit exploration of more than a million single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) simultaneously. The starting point for the statistical analyses used by {GWAS} to determine association between loci and disease is making genotype calls ({AA}, {AB} or {BB}). However, the raw data, microarray probe intensities, are heavily processed before arriving at these calls. Various sophisticated statistical procedures have been proposed for transforming raw data into genotype calls. We find that variability in microarray output quality across different {SNPs}, different arrays and different sample batches have substantial influence on the accuracy of genotype calls made by existing algorithms. Failure to account for these sources of variability can adversely affect the quality of findings reported by the {GWAS}. {RESULTS}: We developed a method based on an enhanced version of the multi-level model used by {CRLMM} version 1. Two key differences are that we now account for variability across batches and improve the call-specific assessment of each call. The new model permits the development of quality metrics for {SNPs}, samples and batches of samples. Using three independent datasets, we demonstrate that the {CRLMM} version 2 outperforms {CRLMM} version 1 and the algorithm provided by Affymetrix, Birdseed. The main advantage of the new approach is that it enables the identification of low-quality {SNPs}, samples and batches. {AVAILABILITY}: Software implementing of the method described in this article is available as free and open source code in the crlmm R/{BioConductor} package. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {DNA} methylation is an epigenetic modification that is studied at a single-base resolution with bisulfite treatment followed by high-throughput sequencing. After alignment of the sequence reads to a reference genome, methylation counts are analyzed to determine genomic regions that are differentially methylated between two or more biological conditions. Even though a variety of software packages is available for different aspects of the bioinformatics analysis, they often produce results that are biased or require excessive computational requirements. {RESULTS}: {DMRfinder} is a novel computational pipeline that identifies differentially methylated regions efficiently. Following alignment, {DMRfinder} extracts methylation counts and performs a modified single-linkage clustering of methylation sites into genomic regions. It then compares methylation levels using beta-binomial hierarchical modeling and Wald tests. Among its innovative attributes are the analyses of novel methylation sites and methylation linkage, as well as the simultaneous statistical analysis of multiple sample groups. To demonstrate its efficiency, {DMRfinder} is benchmarked against other computational approaches using a large published dataset. Contrasting two replicates of the same sample yielded minimal genomic regions with {DMRfinder}, whereas two alternative software packages reported a substantial number of false positives. Further analyses of biological samples revealed fundamental differences between {DMRfinder} and another software package, despite the fact that they utilize the same underlying statistical basis. For each step, {DMRfinder} completed the analysis in a fraction of the time required by other software. {CONCLUSIONS}: Among the computational approaches for identifying differentially methylated regions from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing datasets, {DMRfinder} is the first that integrates all the post-alignment steps in a single package. Compared to other software, {DMRfinder} is extremely efficient and unbiased in this process. {DMRfinder} is free and open-source software, available on {GitHub} ( github.com/jsh58/{DMRfinder} ); it is written in Python and R, and is supported on Linux.},

To understand the molecular basis of sex differences, we evaluated sex-biased gene regulation by constructing sample-specific gene regulatory networks in 29 human healthy tissues using 8,279 whole-genome expression profiles from the Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) project. We find sex-biased regulatory network structures in each tissue. Even though most transcription factors ({TFs}) are not differentially expressed between males and females, many have sex-biased regulatory targeting patterns. In each tissue, genes that are differentially targeted by {TFs} between the sexes are enriched for tissue-related functions and diseases. In brain tissue, for example, genes associated with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are targeted by different sets of {TFs} in each sex. Our systems-based analysis identifies a repertoire of {TFs} that play important roles in sex-specific architecture of gene regulatory networks, and it underlines sex-specific regulatory processes in both health and disease.

As schizophrenia is associated with prenatal brain insults and premorbid cognitive deficits, we tested the a priori hypothesis that serologically defined maternal thyroid deficiency during early gestation to mid-gestation is associated with schizophrenia in offspring. {METHODS}: The investigation is based on the Finnish Prenatal Study of Schizophrenia, a nested case-control study that included archived maternal sera from virtually all pregnancies since 1983 (N = {\textbackslash}textgreater1 million). We identified all offspring in the cohort with a diagnosis of schizophrenia based on the national inpatient and outpatient register and matched them on sex, date of birth, and residence in Finland at time of onset of the case to comparison subjects (1:1) from the cohort. Maternal sera of 1010 case-control pairs were assessed for free thyroxine, and sera of 948 case-control pairs were assessed for thyroid-stimulating hormone. {RESULTS}: Maternal hypothyroxinemia (free thyroxine ≤10th percentile, normal thyroid-stimulating hormone) was associated with an increased odds of schizophrenia (odds ratio = 1.75, 95\% confidence interval = 1.22-2.50, p = .002). When adjusted for maternal psychiatric history, province of birth, and maternal smoking during pregnancy, the association remained significant (odds ratio = 1.70, 95\% confidence interval = 1.13-2.55, p = .010). {CONCLUSIONS}: In a large, national birth cohort, prospectively documented hypothyroxinemia during early gestation to mid-gestation was associated with increased odds of schizophrenia in offspring.

	abstract = {We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in linear regression, with a particular focus on quantifying uncertainty in which variables should be selected. The approach is based on a new model - the "Sum of Single Effects" ({SuSiE}) model - which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of "single-effect" vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure - Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection ({IB}{\textbackslash}{SS}) - which is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. {IB}{\textbackslash}{SS} shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods, but instead of selecting a single variable at each step, {IB}{\textbackslash}{SS} computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under the {SuSiE} model. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a Credible Set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well-suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine-mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outperform existing methods for this task, and illustrate their application to fine-mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell-lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable selection problems.},

These variants can be combined into a polygenic risk score that captures part of an individual's susceptibility to diseases. Polygenic risk scores have been widely applied in research studies, confirming the association between the scores and disease status, but their clinical utility has yet to be established. Polygenic risk scores may be used to estimate an individual's lifetime genetic risk of disease, but the current discriminative ability is low in the general population. Clinical implementation of polygenic risk score ({PRS}) may be useful in cohorts where there is a higher prior probability of disease, for example, in early stages of diseases to assist in diagnosis or to inform treatment choices. Important considerations are the weaker evidence base in application to non-European ancestry and the challenges in translating an individual's {PRS} from a percentile of a normal distribution to a lifetime disease risk. In this review, we consider how {PRS} may be informative at different points in the disease trajectory giving examples of progress in the field and discussing obstacles that need to be addressed before clinical implementation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, numerous applications have demonstrated the potential of deep learning for an improved understanding of biological processes. However, most deep learning tools developed so far are designed to address a specific question on a fixed dataset and/or by a fixed model architecture. Here we present Janggu, a python library facilitates deep learning for genomics applications, aiming to ease data acquisition and model evaluation. Among its key features are special dataset objects, which form a unified and flexible data acquisition and pre-processing framework for genomics data that enables streamlining of future research applications through reusable components. Through a numpy-like interface, these dataset objects are directly compatible with popular deep learning libraries, including keras or pytorch. Janggu offers the possibility to visualize predictions as genomic tracks or by exporting them to the {bigWig} format as well as utilities for keras-based models. We illustrate the functionality of Janggu on several deep learning genomics applications. First, we evaluate different model topologies for the task of predicting binding sites for the transcription factor {JunD}. Second, we demonstrate the framework on published models for predicting chromatin effects. Third, we show that promoter usage measured by {CAGE} can be predicted using {DNase} hypersensitivity, histone modifications and {DNA} sequence features. We improve the performance of these models due to a novel feature in Janggu that allows us to include high-order sequence features. We believe that Janggu will help to significantly reduce repetitive programming overhead for deep learning applications in genomics, and will enable computational biologists to rapidly assess biological hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Humans display reproducible sex differences in cognition and behavior, which may partly reflect intrinsic sex differences in regional brain organization. However, the consistency, causes and consequences of sex differences in the human brain are poorly characterized and hotly debated. In contrast, recent studies in mice-a major model organism for studying neurobiological sex differences-have established: 1) highly consistent sex biases in regional gray matter volume ({GMV}) involving the cortex and classical subcortical foci, 2) a preponderance of regional {GMV} sex differences in brain circuits for social and reproductive behavior, and 3) a spatial coupling between regional {GMV} sex biases and brain expression of sex chromosome genes in adulthood. Here, we directly test translatability of rodent findings to humans. First, using two independent structural-neuroimaging datasets (n {\textbackslash}textgreater 2,000), we find that the spatial map of sex-biased {GMV} in humans is highly reproducible (r {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.8 within and across cohorts). Relative {GMV} is female biased in prefrontal and superior parietal cortices, and male biased in ventral occipitotemporal, and distributed subcortical regions. Second, through systematic comparison with functional neuroimaging meta-analyses, we establish a statistically significant concentration of human {GMV} sex differences within brain regions that subserve face processing. Finally, by imaging-transcriptomic analyses, we show that {GMV} sex differences in human adulthood are specifically and significantly coupled to regional expression of sex-chromosome (vs. autosomal) genes and enriched for distinct cell-type signatures. These findings establish conserved aspects of sex-biased brain development in humans and mice, and shed light on the consistency, candidate causes, and potential functional corollaries of sex-biased brain anatomy in humans.},

We performed the largest breast cancer admixture mapping study with in African American women to identify novel genomic regions associated with the disease. We conducted a genome-wide admixture scan using 2,624 autosomal ancestry informative markers ({AIMs}) in 3,629 breast cancer cases (including 1,968 {ER}-positive, 1093 {ER}-negative, and 601 triple-negative) and 4,658 controls from the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk ({AMBER}) Consortium, a collaborative study of four large geographically different epidemiological studies of breast cancer in African American women. We used an independent case-control study to test for {SNP} association in regions with genome-wide significant admixture signals. We found two novel genome-wide significant regions of excess African ancestry, 4p16.1 and 17q25.1, associated with {ER}-positive breast cancer. Two regions known to harbor breast cancer variants, 10q26 and 11q13, were also identified with excess of African ancestry. Fine-mapping of the identified genome-wide significant regions suggests the presence of significant genetic associations with {ER}-positive breast cancer in 4p16.1 and 11q13. In summary, we identified three novel genomic regions associated with breast cancer risk by {ER} status, suggesting that additional previously unidentified variants may contribute to the racial differences in breast cancer risk in the African American population.},

Recent progress in single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) technologies enables identification of cell-type-specific pathophysiology. However, its application to psychiatric disorders is challenging because of methodological difficulties in analyzing human brains and the confounds due to a lifetime of illness. Brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs}) of the patients are a powerful avenue to investigate the pathophysiological processes. Here, we generated {iPSC}-derived cerebral organoids from monozygotic twins discordant for psychosis. {scRNA}-seq analysis of the organoids revealed enhanced {GABAergic} specification and reduced cell proliferation following diminished Wnt signaling in the patient, which was confirmed in {iPSC}-derived forebrain neuronal cells. Two additional monozygotic twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia also confirmed the excess {GABAergic} specification of the patients' neural progenitor cells. With a well-controlled genetic background, our data suggest that unbalanced specification of excitatory and inhibitory neurons during cortical development underlies psychoses.},

Yet, those techniques are limited by low sequencing depth and/or lacking or inaccurate assignment of unique molecular identifiers ({UMIs}), which are critical for elimination of {PCR} bias and artifacts. We introduce {ScNaUmi}-seq, an approach that combines the high throughput of Oxford Nanopore sequencing with an accurate cell barcode and {UMI} assignment strategy. {UMI} guided error correction allows to generate high accuracy full length sequence information with the 10x Genomics single cell isolation system at high sequencing depths.

Quantitative {mRNA} analysis in developing fetal pig brain revealed spatiotemporal differences with high expression at early embryonic stages, with intense nuclear and cytosolar immunohistochemical staining of the neuroepithelial layer and early neuroblasts, whilst more mature neurons at later embryonic stages had less nuclear staining.

Recent studies have shown that deconvolution algorithms can be applied to computationally estimate cell-type proportions from gene expression data of bulk blood samples, but their performance when applied to brain tissue is unclear. Here, we have generated an immunohistochemistry ({IHC}) dataset for five major cell-types from brain tissue of 70 individuals, who also have bulk cortical gene expression data. With the {IHC} data as the benchmark, this resource enables quantitative assessment of deconvolution algorithms for brain tissue. We apply existing deconvolution algorithms to brain tissue by using marker sets derived from human brain single cell and cell-sorted {RNA}-seq data. We show that these algorithms can indeed produce informative estimates of constituent cell-type proportions. In fact, neuronal subpopulations can also be estimated from bulk brain tissue samples. Further, we show that including the cell-type proportion estimates as confounding factors is important for reducing false associations between Alzheimer's disease phenotypes and gene expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that using more accurate marker sets can substantially improve statistical power in detecting cell-type specific expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}).},

	abstract = {Genetic risk variants for schizophrenia have been linked to many related clinical and biological phenotypes with the hopes of delineating how individual variation across thousands of variants corresponds to the clinical and etiologic heterogeneity within schizophrenia. This has primarily been done using risk score profiling, which aggregates effects across all variants into a single predictor. While effective, this method lacks flexibility in certain domains: risk scores cannot capture nonlinear effects and do not employ any variable selection. We used random forest, an algorithm with this flexibility designed to maximize predictive power, to predict 6 cognitive endophenotypes in a combined sample of psychiatric patients and controls (N = 739) using 77 genetic variants strongly associated with schizophrenia. Tenfold cross-validation was applied to the discovery sample and models were externally validated in an independent sample of similar ancestry (N = 336). Linear approaches, including linear regression and task-specific polygenic risk scores, were employed for comparison. Random forest models for processing speed (P = .019) and visual memory (P = .036) and risk scores developed for verbal (P = .042) and working memory (P = .037) successfully generalized to an independent sample with similar predictive strength and error. As such, we suggest that both methods may be useful for mapping a limited set of predetermined, disease-associated {SNPs} to related phenotypes. Incorporating random forest and other more flexible algorithms into genotype-phenotype mapping inquiries could contribute to parsing heterogeneity within schizophrenia; such algorithms can perform as well as standard methods and can capture a more comprehensive set of potential relationships.},

Kidney-secreted renin enzyme acts on its substrate to form angiotensin {II}, a versatile effector peptide hormone. Every organ is affected by {RAAS} activation and the resultant hypertension, cell proliferation, inflammation, and fibrosis. The imbalance of renin and angiotensin {II} can result in an overwhelming number of chronic and acute diseases. {RAAS} is influenced by other enzymes, hormones, pumps and signaling pathways, hence, this review discusses important facets of this system, its crosstalk with other crucial factors like estrogen, thyroid, cortisol, kallikrein-kinin system, Wnt/{\textbackslash}beta-catenin signaling, and sodium-potassium pump. The nexus of {RAAS} with the above-discussed systems was scantily explored before. So, this review furnishes a new perspective in comprehension of inflammation diseases. It is followed by the formulation of hypotheses, which can contribute to better management of an array of pathologies plaguing mankind. Manipulation of {RAAS}, by bending it towards {ACE}2 expression can regulate endocrine functions, which can be critical for a number of pathological management.

	abstract = {Many complex human phenotypes exhibit sex-differentiated characteristics. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. We generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and in the genetic regulation of gene expression across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project ({GTEx}, v8 release). We demonstrate that sex influences gene expression levels and cellular composition of tissue samples across the human body. A total of 37\% of all genes exhibit sex-biased expression in at least one tissue. We identify cis expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}) with sex-differentiated effects and characterize their cellular origin. By integrating sex-biased {eQTLs} with genome-wide association study data, we identify 58 gene-trait associations that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex. These findings provide an extensive characterization of sex differences in the human transcriptome and its genetic regulation.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Population structure among study subjects may confound genetic association studies, and lack of proper correction can lead to spurious findings. The Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) project largely contains individuals of European ancestry, but the v8 release also includes up to 15\% of individuals of non-European ancestry. Assessing ancestry-based adjustments in {GTEx} improves portability of this research across populations and further characterizes the impact of population structure on {GWAS} colocalization. {RESULTS}: Here, we identify a subset of 117 individuals in {GTEx} (v8) with a high degree of population admixture and estimate genome-wide local ancestry. We perform genome-wide cis-{eQTL} mapping using admixed samples in seven tissues, adjusted by either global or local ancestry. Consistent with previous work, we observe improved power with local ancestry adjustment. At loci where the two adjustments produce different lead variants, we observe 31 loci (0.02\%) where a significant colocalization is called only with one {eQTL} ancestry adjustment method. Notably, both adjustments produce similar numbers of significant colocalizations within each of two different colocalization methods, {COLOC} and {FINEMAP}. Finally, we identify a small subset of {eQTL}-associated variants highly correlated with local ancestry, providing a resource to enhance functional follow-up. {CONCLUSIONS}: We provide a local ancestry map for admixed individuals in the {GTEx} v8 release and describe the impact of ancestry and admixture on gene expression, {eQTLs}, and {GWAS} colocalization. While the majority of the results are concordant between local and global ancestry-based adjustments, we identify distinct advantages and disadvantages to each approach.},

It has a heritability of 60-80\%, much of which is attributable to common risk alleles, suggesting genome-wide association studies can inform our understanding of aetiology. Here, in 69,369 people with schizophrenia and 236,642 controls, we report common variant associations at 270 distinct loci. Using fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we prioritise 19 genes based on protein-coding or {UTR} variation, and 130 genes in total as likely to explain these associations. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit {GRIN}2A and transcription factor {SP}4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in autism and developmental disorder. Associations were concentrated in genes expressed in {CNS} neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, but not other tissues or cell types, and implicated fundamental processes related to neuronal function, particularly synaptic organisation, differentiation and transmission. We identify biological processes of pathophysiological relevance to schizophrenia, show convergence of common and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders, and provide a rich resource of priority genes and variants to advance mechanistic studies.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. {NumPy} is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own {NumPy}-like interfaces and array objects.

It is not known whether tau-related differences begin earlier in life or whether race modifies other {AD}-related biomarkers such as inflammatory proteins. {METHODS}: We performed multiplex cytokine analysis in a healthy middle-aged cohort with family history of {AD} (n = 68) and an older cohort (n = 125) with normal cognition ({NC}), mild cognitive impairment, or {AD} dementia. After determining baseline interleukin ({IL})-9 level and {AD}-associated {IL}-9 change to differ according to race, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for proteins mechanistically linked to {IL}-9 in brains of African Americans and Caucasians (n = 38), and analyzed postmortem {IL}-9-related gene expression profiles in the publicly available Mount Sinai cohort (26 African Americans and 180 Caucasians). {RESULTS}: Compared to Caucasians with {NC}, African Americans with {NC} had lower {CSF} tau, p-Tau181 , and {IL}-9 levels in both living cohorts. Conversely, {AD} was only correlated with increased {CSF} {IL}-9 levels in African Americans but not Caucasians. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed perivascular, neuronal, and glial cells immunoreactive to {IL}-9, and quantitative analysis in independent {US} cohorts showed {AD} to correlate with molecular changes (upstream differentiation marker and downstream effector cell marker) of {IL}-9 upregulation only in African Americans but not Caucasians. {INTERPRETATION}: Baseline and {AD}-associated {IL}-9 differences between African Americans and Caucasians point to distinct molecular phenotypes for {AD} according to ancestry.

	abstract = {Filtering the discriminative metabolites from high dimension metabolome data is very important in metabolomics study. Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination ({SVM}-{RFE}) is an efficient feature selection technique and has shown promising applications in the analysis of the metabolome data. {SVM}-{RFE} measures the weights of the features according to the support vectors, noise and non-informative variables in the high dimension data may affect the hyper-plane of the {SVM} learning model. Hence we proposed a mutual information ({MI})-{SVM}-{RFE} method which filters out noise and non-informative variables by means of artificial variables and {MI}, then conducts {SVM}-{RFE} to select the most discriminative features. A serum metabolomics data set from patients with chronic hepatitis B, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) was used to demonstrate the validation of our method. An accuracy of 74.33±2.98\% to distinguish among three liver diseases was obtained, better than 72.00±4.15\% from the original {SVM}-{RFE}. Thirty-four ion features were defined to distinguish among the control and 3 liver diseases, 17 of them were identified. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Surprisingly, most of the existing feature selection algorithms assume the problems to address are either supervised or unsupervised, while supervised and unsupervised samples are often simultaneously available in real-world applications. Semi-supervised feature selection methods are thus necessary, and many solutions have been proposed recently. However, almost all of them exclusively tackle classification problems. This paper introduces a semi-supervised feature selection algorithm which is specifically designed for regression problems. It relies on the notion of Laplacian score, a quantity recently introduced in the unsupervised framework. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Yet, current methods for differential expression are inadequate for cross-individual testing for these repeated measures designs. Most problematic, we observe across multiple datasets that current methods can give reproducible false-positive findings that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression, yet are unrelated to the trait of interest. Here, we introduce a statistical software package, dream, that increases power, controls the false positive rate, enables multiple types of hypothesis tests, and integrates with standard workflows. In 12 analyses in 6 independent datasets, dream yields biological insight not found with existing software while addressing the issue of reproducible false-positive findings. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Dream is available within the {variancePartition} Bioconductor package at http://bioconductor.org/packages/{variancePartition}. {CONTACT}: gabriel.hoffman@mssm.edu. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Schizophrenia ({SCZ}) is a devastating genetic mental disorder. Identification of the {SCZ} risk genes in brains is helpful to understand this disease. Thus, we first used the minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance ({mRMR}) approach to integrate the genome-wide sequence analysis results on {SCZ} and the expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}) data from ten brain tissues to identify the genes related to {SCZ}. Second, we adopted the variance inflation factor regression algorithm to identify their interacting genes in brains. Third, using multiple analysis methods, we explored and validated their roles. By means of the aforementioned procedures, we have found that (1) the cerebellum may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of {SCZ} and (2) {ITIH}4 may be utilized as a clinical biomarker for the diagnosis of {SCZ}. These interesting findings may stimulate novel strategy for developing new drugs against {SCZ}.

Whilst understanding of their pathobiology remains limited, large case-control studies have recently identified single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) associated with these disorders. However, discerning the functional effects of these {SNPs} has been difficult as the associated causal genes are unknown. Here we evaluated whether schizophrenia and affective disorder associated-{SNPs} are correlated with gene expression within human brain tissue. Specifically, to identify expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}), we leveraged disorder-associated {SNPs} identified from 11 genome-wide association studies with gene expression levels in post-mortem, neurologically-normal tissue from two independent human brain tissue expression datasets ({UK} Brain Expression Consortium ({UKBEC}) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx})). Utilizing stringent multi-region meta-analyses, we identified 2,224 cis-{eQTLs} associated with expression of 40 genes, including 11 non-coding {RNAs}. One cis-{eQTL}, rs16969968, results in a functionally disruptive missense mutation in {CHRNA}5, a schizophrenia-implicated gene. Importantly, comparing across tissues, we find that blood {eQTLs} capture {\textbackslash}textless 10\% of brain cis-{eQTLs}. Contrastingly, {\textbackslash}textgreater 30\% of brain-associated {eQTLs} are significant in tibial nerve. This study identifies putatively causal genes whose expression in region-specific tissue may contribute to the risk of schizophrenia and affective disorders.},

The current study examined the genetic variability of {GVs} across ethnic populations. To assess the genetic variability across populations, the 'variability indices' ({VIs}) of the 128 schizophrenia-associated {GVs} were calculated. We used 2504 genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project taken from 26 worldwide healthy samples comprising five major ethnicities: East Asian ({EAS}: n=504), European ({EUR}: n=503), African ({AFR}: n=661), American ({AMR}: n=347) and South Asian ({SAS}: n=489). The {GV} with the lowest variability was rs36068923 ({VI}=1.07). The minor allele frequencies ({MAFs}) were 0.189, 0.192, 0.256, 0.183 and 0.194 for {EAS}, {EUR}, {AFR}, {AMR} and {SAS}, respectively. The {GV} with the highest variability was rs7432375 ({VI}=9.46). The {MAFs} were 0.791, 0.435, 0.041, 0.594 and 0.508 for {EAS}, {EUR}, {AFR}, {AMR} and {SAS}, respectively. When we focused on the {EAS} and {EUR} population, the allele frequencies of 86 {GVs} significantly differed between the {EAS} and {EUR} (P{\textbackslash}textless 3.91 × 10-4). The {GV} with the highest variability was rs4330281 (P=1.55 × 10-138). The {MAFs} were 0.023 and 0.519 for the {EAS} and {EUR}, respectively. The {GV} with the lowest variability was rs2332700 (P=9.80 × 10-1). The {MAFs} were similar between these populations (that is, 0.246 and 0.247 for the {EAS} and {EUR}, respectively). Interestingly, the mean allele frequencies of the {GVs} did not significantly differ between these populations (P{\textbackslash}textgreater0.05).

Recently, a number of technical hurdles have been described that add to a reluctance of including chromosome X in a {GWAS}, including complications in genotype calling, imputation, and selection of test statistics. To overcome this, we provide a "how to" guide for analyzing X chromosomal data within a standard {GWAS}. Following a general pipeline for {GWAS}, we highlight the steps in which the X chromosome requires specific attention, and we give tentative advice for each of these. Through this, we show that by selection of sensible algorithms and parameter settings, the inclusion of chromosome X in {GWAS} is manageable. Closing this gap is expected to further elucidate the genetic background of complex diseases, especially of those with sex-specific features. {\textbackslash}copyright 2014 {WILEY} {PERIODICALS}, {INC}.},

The most significant association with {AAO} was observed with {SNP} rs7819815 (P = 3.10×10(-7)) at 8q24.22. The next best signal was at 4q25 in {COL}25A1 gene (rs17039583, P = 4.30×10(-6)) and the third region was at 4p16.1 (rs17407555, P = 4.56×10(-6) , near {RAF}1P1, and rs4697924, P = 1.23×10(-5) within {WDR}1 gene).

In patient-derived fibroblasts, we found a complete loss of {SORD} protein and increased intracellular sorbitol. Furthermore, the serum fasting sorbitol levels in patients were dramatically increased. In Drosophila, loss of {SORD} orthologs caused synaptic degeneration and progressive motor impairment. Reducing the polyol influx by treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors normalized intracellular sorbitol levels in patient-derived fibroblasts and in Drosophila, and also dramatically ameliorated motor and eye phenotypes. Together, these findings establish a novel and potentially treatable cause of neuropathy and may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes.},

	abstract = {We present the Network-based Biased Tree Ensembles ({NetBiTE}) method for drug sensitivity prediction and drug sensitivity biomarker identification in cancer using a combination of prior knowledge and gene expression data. Our devised method consists of a biased tree ensemble that is built according to a probabilistic bias weight distribution. The bias weight distribution is obtained from the assignment of high weights to the drug targets and propagating the assigned weights over a protein-protein interaction network such as {STRING}. The propagation of weights, defines neighborhoods of influence around the drug targets and as such simulates the spread of perturbations within the cell, following drug administration. Using a synthetic dataset, we showcase how application of biased tree ensembles ({BiTE}) results in significant accuracy gains at a much lower computational cost compared to the unbiased random forests ({RF}) algorithm. We then apply {NetBiTE} to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer ({GDSC}) dataset and demonstrate that {NetBiTE} outperforms {RF} in predicting {IC}50 drug sensitivity, only for drugs that target membrane receptor pathways ({MRPs}): {RTK}, {EGFR} and {IGFR} signaling pathways. We propose based on the {NetBiTE} results, that for drugs that inhibit {MRPs}, the expression of target genes prior to drug administration is a biomarker for {IC}50 drug sensitivity following drug administration. We further verify and reinforce this proposition through control studies on, {PI}3K/{MTOR} signaling pathway inhibitors, a drug category that does not target {MRPs}, and through assignment of dummy targets to {MRP} inhibiting drugs and investigating the variation in {NetBiTE} accuracy.},

	abstract = {Population substructure can lead to confounding in tests for genetic association, and failure to adjust properly can result in spurious findings. Here we address this issue of confounding by considering the impact of global ancestry (average ancestry across the genome) and local ancestry (ancestry at a specific chromosomal location) on regression parameters and relative power in ancestry-adjusted and -unadjusted models. We examine theoretical expectations under different scenarios for population substructure; applying different regression models, verifying and generalizing using simulations, and exploring the findings in real-world admixed populations. We show that admixture does not lead to confounding when the trait locus is tested directly in a single admixed population. However, if there is more complex population structure or a marker locus in linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) with the trait locus is tested, both global and local ancestry can be confounders. Additionally, we show the genotype parameters of adjusted and unadjusted models all provide tests for {LD} between the marker and trait locus, but in different contexts. The local ancestry adjusted model tests for {LD} in the ancestral populations, while tests using the unadjusted and the global ancestry adjusted models depend on {LD} in the admixed population(s), which may be enriched due to different ancestral allele frequencies. Practically, this implies that global-ancestry adjustment should be used for screening, but local-ancestry adjustment may better inform fine mapping and provide better effect estimates at trait loci. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 {WILEY} {PERIODICALS}, {INC}.},

However, the biomedical data inequality between different ethnic groups is set to generate new health care disparities through data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions. Using an extensive set of machine learning experiments on cancer omics data, we find that current prevalent schemes of multiethnic machine learning are prone to generating significant model performance disparities between ethnic groups. We show that these performance disparities are caused by data inequality and data distribution discrepancies between ethnic groups. We also find that transfer learning can improve machine learning model performance for data-disadvantaged ethnic groups, and thus provides an effective approach to reduce health care disparities arising from data inequality among ethnic groups.},

There were multiple recruitment sites throughout the United States that included individuals with Alzheimer disease and controls of African American ancestry. Analysis began October 2018 and ended September 2019. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. {RESULTS}: A total of 2784 individuals with Alzheimer disease (1944 female [69.8\%]) and 5222 controls (3743 female [71.7\%]) were analyzed (mean [{SD}] age at last evaluation, 74.2 [13.6] years). Associations with 4 novel common loci centered near the intracellular glycoprotein trafficking gene {EDEM}1 (3p26; P = 8.9 × 10-7), near the immune response gene {ALCAM} (3q13; P = 9.3 × 10-7), within {GPC}6 (13q31; P = 4.1 × 10-7), a gene critical for recruitment of glutamatergic receptors to the neuronal membrane, and within {VRK}3 (19q13.33; P = 3.5 × 10-7), a gene involved in glutamate neurotoxicity, were identified. In addition, several loci associated with rare variants, including a genome-wide significant intergenic locus near {IGF}1R at 15q26 (P = 1.7 × 10-9) and 6 additional loci with suggestive significance (P ≤ 5 × 10-7) such as {API}5 at 11p12 (P = 8.8 × 10-8) and {RBFOX}1 at 16p13 (P = 5.4 × 10-7) were identified. Gene expression data from brain tissue demonstrate association of {ALCAM}, {ARAP}1, {GPC}6, and {RBFOX}1 with brain {\textbackslash}beta-amyloid load. Of 25 known loci associated with Alzheimer disease in non-Hispanic White individuals, only {APOE}, {ABCA}7, {TREM}2, {BIN}1, {CD}2AP, {FERMT}2, and {WWOX} were implicated at a nominal significance level or stronger in African American individuals. Pathway analyses strongly support the notion that immunity, lipid processing, and intracellular trafficking pathways underlying Alzheimer disease in African American individuals overlap with those observed in non-Hispanic White individuals. A new pathway emerging from these analyses is the kidney system, suggesting a novel mechanism for Alzheimer disease that needs further exploration. {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: While the major pathways involved in Alzheimer disease etiology in African American individuals are similar to those in non-Hispanic White individuals, the disease-associated loci within these pathways differ.},

	abstract = {Gene regulatory network is a complicated set of interactions between genetic materials, which dictates how cells develop in living organisms and react to their surrounding environment. Robust comprehension of these interactions would help explain how cells function as well as predict their reactions to external factors. This knowledge can benefit both developmental biology and clinical research such as drug development or epidemiology research. Recently, the rapid advance of single-cell sequencing technologies, which pushed the limit of transcriptomic profiling to the individual cell level, opens up an entirely new area for regulatory network research. To exploit this new abundant source of data and take advantage of data in single-cell resolution, a number of computational methods have been proposed to uncover the interactions hidden by the averaging process in standard bulk sequencing. In this article, we review 15 such network inference methods developed for single-cell data. We discuss their underlying assumptions, inference techniques, usability, and pros and cons. In an extensive analysis using simulation, we also assess the methods' performance, sensitivity to dropout and time complexity. The main objective of this survey is to assist not only life scientists in selecting suitable methods for their data and analysis purposes but also computational scientists in developing new methods by highlighting outstanding challenges in the field that remain to be addressed in the future development. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2020.

For a subset of these children, antiseizure medications or epilepsy surgery may result in seizure freedom. However, there are limited options for treating or curing the other conditions, and epilepsy surgery is not an option in all cases of pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Understanding the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying {MCD} is a necessary step in elucidating novel therapeutic targets. The tish (telencephalic internal structural heterotopia) rat is a unique model of {MCD} with spontaneous seizures, but the underlying genetic mutation(s) have remained unknown. {DNA} and {RNA}-sequencing revealed that a deletion encompassing a previously unannotated first exon markedly diminished Eml1 transcript and protein abundance in the tish brain. Developmental electrographic characterization of the tish rat revealed early-onset of spontaneous spike-wave discharge ({SWD}) bursts beginning at postnatal day (P) 17. A dihybrid cross demonstrated that the mutant Eml1 allele segregates with the observed dysplastic cortex and the early-onset {SWD} bursts in monogenic autosomal recessive frequencies. Our data link the development of the bilateral, heterotopic dysplastic cortex of the tish rat to a deletion in Eml1. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Here we performed whole-genome sequencing analyses of 426 individuals-comprising 50 ethnolinguistic groups, including previously unsampled populations-to explore the breadth of genomic diversity across Africa. We uncovered more than 3 million previously undescribed variants, most of which were found among individuals from newly sampled ethnolinguistic groups, as well as 62 previously unreported loci that are under strong selection, which were predominantly found in genes that are involved in viral immunity, {DNA} repair and metabolism. We observed complex patterns of ancestral admixture and putative-damaging and novel variation, both within and between populations, alongside evidence that Zambia was a likely intermediate site along the routes of expansion of Bantu-speaking populations. Pathogenic variants in genes that are currently characterized as medically relevant were uncommon-but in other genes, variants denoted as 'likely pathogenic' in the {ClinVar} database were commonly observed. Collectively, these findings refine our current understanding of continental migration, identify gene flow and the response to human disease as strong drivers of genome-level population variation, and underscore the scientific imperative for a broader characterization of the genomic diversity of African individuals to understand human ancestry and improve health.},

This study aimed to identify modifier loci associated with an earlier {AAO} of schizophrenia. A genome-wide association analysis ({GWAS}) was conducted in 94 schizophrenia probands with the earliest {AAO} and 91 with the latest {AAO}. Candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) were then genotyped in the co-affected siblings and unrelated probands. Multi-{SNP} genetic risk scores ({GRS}) composed of the candidate loci were used to distinguish patients with an early or late {AAO}. The 14-{SNP} {GRS} could distinguish the co-affected siblings (n = 90) of the earliest probands from those (n = 91) of the latest probands. When 132 patients with an earlier {AAO} and 158 patients with a later {AAO} were included, a significant trend in the 14-{SNP} {GRS} was detected among those unrelated probands from 4 family groups with the earliest, earlier, later, and latest {AAO}. The overall effect of the 14 {SNPs} on an {AAO} in schizophrenia was verified using co-affected siblings of the {GWAS} probands and trend effect across unrelated patients. Preliminary network analysis of these loci revealed the involvement of {PARK}2, a gene intensively reported in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia research.},

In addition, genetic variation in {LRP}1 and {LRP}6 has been linked with various factors that are related to risk of ischaemic stroke. The aim of this study was to examine the association of {LRP}1 and {LRP}6 gene variants with risk of ischaemic stroke as part of the Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study ({ISGS}). {METHODS}: A Caucasian series (434 stroke patients, 319 controls) and an African American series (161 stroke patients, 116 controls) were included. Fourteen {LRP}6 variants and three {LRP}1 variants were genotyped and assessed for association with ischaemic stroke. {RESULTS}: In the Caucasian series, significant associations with ischaemic stroke were observed for {LRP}6 rs2075241 [odds ratio ({OR}) 0.42, P = 0.023], rs2302685 ({OR} 0.44, P = 0.049), rs7975614 ({OR} 0.07, P = 0.017), rs10492120 ({OR} 0.62, P = 0.036) and rs10743980 ({OR} 0.66, P = 0.037). Risk of ischaemic stroke was significantly lower for carriers of any of these five protective {LRP}6 variants (24.0\% of subjects) compared to non-carriers ({OR} 0.57, P = 0.003). The protective association for {LRP}6 rs2075241 was observed at a similar magnitude across ischaemic stroke subtypes, whilst the effects of rs23022685, rs10492120 and rs10743980 were most apparent for cardioembolic and large vessel stroke. In the African American series, {LRP}1 rs11172113 was associated with an increased risk of stroke ({OR} 1.89, P = 0.006). {CONCLUSIONS}: The results of our preliminary study provide evidence that {LRP}6 and {LRP}1 variants may be associated with risk of ischaemic stroke.

	abstract = {An increasing focus on personalized medicine is driving a renewed effort to understand the impact of ethnic and genetic background on treatment outcomes. Since responses to psychopharmacological treatments continue to be sub-optimal, there is a pressing need to identify markers of tolerability and efficacy. Pharmacogenomic studies aim to find such markers within the human genome, and have made some progress in recent years. Progress has been slower in populations with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Here we review 10 genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) that assessed outcomes after antidepressant, antipsychotic, or mood stabilizer treatment. These studies used samples collected by the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness ({CATIE}), Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression ({STAR}*D), and Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder ({STEP}-{BD}) studies. We highlight findings from African American and European American participants since they are the largest groups studied, but we also address issues related to Asian and Hispanic groups. None of the {GWAS} we reviewed identified individual genetic markers at genome-wide significance, probably due to limited sample sizes. However, all the studies found poorer outcomes among African American participants. Some of this disparity seems to be explained by psychosocial and economic disadvantages, but at least 2 studies found that widespread genetic differences between participants of European and African ancestry also play an important role. Non-European groups are underrepresented in these studies, but the differences that are evident so far suggest that poorer outcomes among African Americans are not inevitable and may be particularly suited to pharmacogenomic strategies. The vision of more personalized psychopharmacology may critically depend on larger studies in more diverse human populations.},

We determined {DNMT}1 structures in complex with preferred {DNA} substrates revealing that {DNMT}1 employs flanking sequence-dependent base flipping mechanisms, with large structural rearrangements of the {DNA} correlating with low catalytic activity. Moreover, flanking sequences influence the conformational dynamics of the active site and cofactor binding pocket.

	abstract = {The etiology of Parkinson's disease is largely unknown. Genome-wide transcriptomic studies in bulk brain tissue have identified several molecular signatures associated with the disease. While these studies have the potential to shed light into the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, they are also limited by two major confounders: {RNA} post-mortem degradation and heterogeneous cell type composition of bulk tissue samples. We performed {RNA} sequencing following ribosomal {RNA} depletion in the prefrontal cortex of 49 individuals from two independent case-control cohorts. Using cell type specific markers, we estimated the cell type composition for each sample and included this in our analysis models to compensate for the variation in cell type proportions. Ribosomal {RNA} depletion followed by capture by random primers resulted in substantially more even transcript coverage, compared to poly(A) capture, in post-mortem tissue. Moreover, we show that cell type composition is a major confounder of differential gene expression analysis in the Parkinson's disease brain. Accounting for cell type proportions attenuated numerous transcriptomic signatures that have been previously associated with Parkinson's disease, including vesicle trafficking, synaptic transmission, immune and mitochondrial function. Conversely, pathways related to endoplasmic reticulum, lipid oxidation and unfolded protein response were strengthened and surface as the top differential gene expression signatures in the Parkinson's disease prefrontal cortex. Our results indicate that differential gene expression signatures in Parkinson's disease bulk brain tissue are significantly confounded by underlying differences in cell type composition. Modeling cell type heterogeneity is crucial in order to unveil transcriptomic signatures that represent regulatory changes in the Parkinson's disease brain and are, therefore, more likely to be associated with underlying disease mechanisms.},

Its complexity, polygenicity, and small-effect-size and cell-type-specific contributors have hindered mechanistic elucidation and the search for new therapeutics. Here, we present the first single-cell dissection of schizophrenia, across 500,000+ cells from 48 postmortem human prefrontal cortex samples, including 24 schizophrenia cases and 24 controls. We annotate 20 cell types/states, providing a high-resolution atlas of schizophrenia-altered genes and pathways in each. We find neurons are the most affected cell type, with deep-layer cortico-cortical projection neurons and parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons showing significant transcriptional changes converging on genetically-implicated regions. We discover a novel excitatory-neuron cell-state indicative of transcriptional resilience and enriched in schizophrenia subjects with less-perturbed transcriptional signatures. We identify key trans-acting factors as candidate drivers of observed transcriptional perturbations, including {MEF}2C, {TCF}4, {SOX}5, and {SATB}2, and map their binding patterns in postmortem human neurons. These factors regulate distinct gene sets underlying fetal neurodevelopment and adult synaptic function, bridging two leading models of schizophrenia pathogenesis.

	abstract = {Although single-cell {RNA} sequencing studies have begun to provide compendia of cell expression profiles1-9, it has been difficult to systematically identify and localize all molecular cell types in individual organs to create a full molecular cell atlas. Here, using droplet- and plate-based single-cell {RNA} sequencing of approximately 75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, we create an extensive cell atlas of the human lung. We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution.},

We then partitioned the common {SNP} heritability of 111 genome-wide association study summary statistics of European (average n ≈ 189,000) and East Asian (average n ≈ 157,000) origin. {IMPACT} annotations captured consistent {SNP} heritability between populations, suggesting prioritization of shared functional variants. Variant prioritization using {IMPACT} resulted in increased trans-ancestry portability of polygenic risk scores from Europeans to East Asians across all 21 phenotypes analyzed (49.9\% mean relative increase in R2).

Here, we report no evidence of any undesirable impacts of genetically modified ({GM}) grapevine rootstock on its biotic environment. Using state of the art metagenomics, we analysed two compartments in depth, the targeted Grapevine fanleaf virus ({GFLV}) populations and nontargeted root-associated microbiota. Our results reveal no statistically significant differences in the genetic diversity of bacteria that can be linked to the {GM} trait. In addition, no novel virus or bacteria recombinants of biosafety concern can be associated with transgenic grapevine rootstocks cultivated in commercial vineyard soil under greenhouse conditions for over 6 years. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {Ischemic stroke, which accounts for 75-80\% of all strokes, is the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The post-stroke immune response has recently emerged as a new breakthrough target in the treatment strategy for ischemic stroke. Glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, are the primary components of the peri-infarct environment in the central nervous system ({CNS}) and have been implicated in post-stroke immune regulation. However, increasing evidence suggests that glial cells exert beneficial and detrimental effects during ischemic stroke. Microglia, which survey {CNS} homeostasis and regulate innate immune responses, are rapidly activated after ischemic stroke. Activated microglia release inflammatory cytokines that induce neuronal tissue injury. By contrast, anti-inflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors secreted by alternatively activated microglia are beneficial for recovery after ischemic stroke. Astrocyte activation and reactive gliosis in ischemic stroke contribute to limiting brain injury and re-establishing {CNS} homeostasis. However, glial scarring hinders neuronal reconnection and extension. Neuroinflammation affects the demyelination and remyelination of oligodendrocytes. Myelin-associated antigens released from oligodendrocytes activate peripheral T cells, thereby resulting in the autoimmune response. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which can differentiate into oligodendrocytes, follow an ischemic stroke and may result in functional recovery. Herein, we discuss the mechanisms of post-stroke immune regulation mediated by glial cells and the interaction between glial cells and neurons. In addition, we describe the potential roles of various glial cells at different stages of ischemic stroke and discuss future intervention targets.

	abstract = {Parkinson disease ({PD}) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is 1.5 times more common in males than in females. While motor progression tends to be more aggressive in males, little is known about sex difference in cognitive progression. We tested the hypothesis that there are sex differences in cognitive dysfunction in non-demented {PD}. We evaluated 84 participants (38 females) with {PD} and 59 controls (27 females) for demographic variables and cognitive function, including attention, working memory, executive function, and processing speed. Multivariate {ANOVA} revealed no significant differences between groups for demographic variables, including age, years of education, global cogntition, daytime sleepiness, predicted premorbid {IQ}, {UPDRS} score, {PD} phenotype, or disease duration. For cognitive variables, we found poorer performance in males versus females with {PD} for measures of executive function and processing speed, but no difference between male and female controls. Specifically, {PD} males showed greater deficits in Verbal Fluency (category fluency, category switching, and category switching accuracy), Color Word Interference (inhibition), and speed of processing ({SDMT}). There were no differences in measures of working memory or attention across sex and inconsistent findings for switching. Our data indicate that males with {PD} have significantly greater executive and processing speed impairments compared to females despite no differences in demographic variables or other measures of disease severity. Our findings are consistent with the steeper slope of disease progression reported in males with {PD}. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2020.},

The sources of this disparity are largely unknown, but interactions between genetic and sex effects are likely contributors. We examined gene-by-sex (G × S) interactions in a worldwide sample of 2,142 {NSCL}/P cases and 1,700 controls recruited from 13 countries. First, we performed genome-wide joint tests of the genetic (G) and G × S effects genome-wide using logistic regression assuming an additive genetic model and adjusting for 18 principal components of ancestry. We further interrogated loci with suggestive results from the joint test ( p {\textbackslash}textless 1.00 × 10 -5 ) by examining the G × S effects from the same model. Out of the 133 loci with suggestive results ( p {\textbackslash}textless 1.00 × 10 -5 ) for the joint test, we observed one genome-wide significant G × S effect in the 10q21 locus (rs72804706; p = 6.69 × 10 -9 ; {OR} = 2.62 {CI} [1.89, 3.62]) and 16 suggestive G × S effects. At the intergenic 10q21 locus, the risk of {NSCL}/P is estimated to increase with additional copies of the minor allele for females, but the opposite effect for males. Our observation that the impact of genetic variants on {NSCL}/P risk differs for males and females may further our understanding of the genetic architecture of {NSCL}/P and the sex differences underlying clefts and other birth defects. {\textbackslash}copyright 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Yet, the pathophysiological processes involved in {AD} onset and progression are still poorly understood. Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain could contribute for a better understanding of the {AD} pathology. In this work, we probed the differential expression of genes in different brain regions of healthy and {AD} adult subjects using data from three large transcriptomic studies: Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai Brain Bank ({MSBB}), and {ROSMAP}. Using a combination of differential expression of gene and isoform switch analyses, we provide a detailed landscape of gene expression alterations in the temporal and frontal lobes, harboring brain areas affected at early and late stages of the {AD} pathology, respectively. Next, we took advantage of an indirect approach to assign the complex gene expression changes revealed in bulk {RNAseq} to individual cell types/subtypes of the adult brain. This strategy allowed us to identify previously overlooked gene expression changes in the brain of {AD} patients. Among these alterations, we show isoform switches in the {AD} causal gene amyloid-beta precursor protein ({APP}) and the risk gene bridging integrator 1 ({BIN}1), which could have important functional consequences in neuronal cells. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze {RNAseq} data in {AD} and other neurodegenerative diseases based on both gene/transcript expression and regional/cell-type specificities.},

We present a method, {SoupX}, for quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating "background-corrected" cell expression profiles that seamlessly integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing technologies, we demonstrate that its application improves biological interpretation of otherwise misleading data, as well as improving quality control metrics. {CONCLUSIONS}: We present {SoupX}, a tool for removing ambient {RNA} contamination from droplet-based single-cell {RNA} sequencing experiments.

	abstract = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.

	abstract = {As the number of single-cell transcriptomics datasets grows, the natural next step is to integrate the accumulating data to achieve a common ontology of cell types and states. However, it is not straightforward to compare gene expression levels across datasets and to automatically assign cell type labels in a new dataset based on existing annotations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, {scVI}, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of {scRNA}-seq data, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single-cell {ANnotation} using Variational Inference ({scANVI}), a semi-supervised variant of {scVI} designed to leverage existing cell state annotations. We demonstrate that {scVI} and {scANVI} compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings. In contrast to existing methods, {scVI} and {scANVI} integrate multiple datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for downstream tasks, such as differential expression. Both methods are easily accessible through scvi-tools. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021 The Authors. Published under the terms of the {CC} {BY} 4.0 license.},

The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). {METHODS}: The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2021 Statistical Update is the product of a full year's worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year's edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, the global burden of cardiovascular disease, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors related to cardiovascular disease. {RESULTS}: Each of the 27 chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics. {CONCLUSIONS}: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.},

Inappropriate sorbitol accumulation in some patients may be the result of polymorphic variation in the human sorbitol dehydrogenase gene, causing reduced expression levels or enzymatic activity.

The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the {TOPMed} goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through {dbGaP} (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes)1. In the first 53,831 {TOPMed} samples, we detected more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97\% have frequencies of less than 1\% and 46\% are singletons that are present in only one individual (53\% among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in {TOPMed} studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining {TOPMed} haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01\%.},

In the aged brain, {WAMs} form independent of apolipoprotein E ({APOE}), in contrast to mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, in which microglia with the {WAM} gene signature are generated prematurely and in an {APOE}-dependent pathway similar to {DAMs}. Within the white matter, microglia frequently cluster in nodules, where they are engaged in clearing degenerated myelin.

Genetic variants that modulate the expression of potential drug targets can be utilized to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. We therefore employed Mendelian Randomization ({MR}) on gene expression measured in brain tissue to identify drug targets involved in neurological and psychiatric diseases. We conducted a two-sample {MR} using cis-acting brain-derived expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}) from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer's Disease consortium ({AMP}-{AD}) and the {CommonMind} Consortium ({CMC}) meta-analysis study (n = 1,286) as genetic instruments to predict the effects of 7,137 genes on 12 neurological and psychiatric disorders. We conducted Bayesian colocalization analysis on the top {MR} findings (using P{\textbackslash}textless 6x10-7 as evidence threshold, Bonferroni-corrected for 80,557 {MR} tests) to confirm sharing of the same causal variants between gene expression and trait in each genomic region. We then intersected the colocalized genes with known monogenic disease genes recorded in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ({OMIM}) and with genes annotated as drug targets in the Open Targets platform to identify promising drug targets. 80 {eQTLs} showed {MR} evidence of a causal effect, from which we prioritised 47 genes based on colocalization with the trait. We causally linked the expression of 23 genes with schizophrenia and a single gene each with anorexia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder within the psychiatric diseases and 9 genes with Alzheimer's disease, 6 genes with Parkinson's disease, 4 genes with multiple sclerosis and two genes with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis within the neurological diseases we tested. From these we identified five genes ({ACE}, {GPNMB}, {KCNQ}5, {RERE} and {SUOX}) as attractive drug targets that may warrant follow-up in functional studies and clinical trials, demonstrating the value of this study design for discovering drug targets in neuropsychiatric diseases.},

Conventional assays to map regulatory elements via open chromatin analysis of primary tissues is hindered by sample heterogeneity. Single cell analysis of accessible chromatin ({scATAC}-seq) can overcome this limitation. However, the high-level noise of each single cell profile and the large volume of data pose unique computational challenges. Here, we introduce {SnapATAC}, a software package for analyzing {scATAC}-seq datasets. {SnapATAC} dissects cellular heterogeneity in an unbiased manner and map the trajectories of cellular states. Using the Nyström method, {SnapATAC} can process data from up to a million cells. Furthermore, {SnapATAC} incorporates existing tools into a comprehensive package for analyzing single cell {ATAC}-seq dataset. As demonstration of its utility, {SnapATAC} is applied to 55,592 single-nucleus {ATAC}-seq profiles from the mouse secondary motor cortex. The analysis reveals ∼370,000 candidate regulatory elements in 31 distinct cell populations in this brain region and inferred candidate cell-type specific transcriptional regulators.},

Analysis of the sequence 3' of the shift site demonstrated that an {RNA} pseudoknot in Ma3 is important for promoting efficient -1 frame-shifting. Ma3 is a member of a family of six genes in humans whose protein products contain homology to retroviral Gag proteins. The -1 frameshift site and pseudoknot structure are conserved in other mammals, but there are some sequence differences. Although the functions of the Ma genes are unknown, the serious neurological effects of ectopic expression in tumor cells indicate their importance in the brain.},

To address this, we use an efficient multiplexing strategy to differentiate 215 human induced pluripotent stem cell ({iPSC}) lines toward a midbrain neural fate, including dopaminergic neurons, and use single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) to profile over 1 million cells across three differentiation time points. The proportion of neurons produced by each cell line is highly reproducible and is predictable by robust molecular markers expressed in pluripotent cells. Expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) were characterized at different stages of neuronal development and in response to rotenone-induced oxidative stress. Of these, 1,284 {eQTL} colocalize with known neurological trait risk loci, and 46\% are not found in the Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) catalog.

	abstract = {Microglial activation participates in white matter injury after cerebral hypoperfusion. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we explore whether activated microglia aggravate white matter injury via complement C3-C3aR pathway after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 80) underwent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 7, 14, and 28 days. Cerebral vessel density and blood flow were examined by synchrotron radiation angiography and three-dimensional arterial spin labeling. Neurobehavioral assessments, {CLARITY} imaging, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate activation of microglia and C3-C3aR pathway. Furthermore, C3aR knockout mice were used to establish the causal relationship of C3-C3aR signaling on microglia activation and white matter injury after hypoperfusion. Results: Cerebral vessel density and blood flow were reduced after hypoperfusion (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Spatial learning and memory deficits and white matter injury were shown (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.05). These impairments were correlated with aberrant microglia activation and an increase in the number of reactive microglia adhering to and phagocytosed myelin in the hypoperfusion group (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.05), which were accompanied by the up-regulation of complement C3 and its receptors C3aR (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Genetic deletion of C3ar1 significantly inhibited aberrant microglial activation and reversed white matter injury after hypoperfusion (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Furthermore, the C3aR antagonist {SB}290157 decreased the number of microglia adhering to myelin (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.05), attenuated white matter injury and cognitive deficits in chronic hypoperfusion rats (p{\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that aberrant activated microglia aggravate white matter injury via C3-C3aR pathway during chronic hypoperfusion. These findings indicate C3aR plays a critical role in mediating neuroinflammation and white matter injury through aberrant microglia activation, which provides a novel therapeutic target for the small vessel disease and vascular dementia. {\textbackslash}copyright The author(s).},

Being a highly vascularized organ, the lung receives dual blood supply from both the pulmonary and bronchial circulation. Therefore, pericytes likely play a prominent role in lung physiology given their localization in the perivascular niche. New genetic approaches have increased our understanding of the origin and the diverse functions of lung pericytes. Lung pericytes are myofibroblast progenitors, contributing to development of fibrosis in mouse models. Lung pericytes are also capable of responding to danger signals and amplify the inflammatory response through elaboration of cytokines and adhesion molecules. In this chapter, we describe the molecular, anatomical, and phenotypical characterization of lung pericytes. We further highlight their potential roles in the pathogenesis of lung diseases including pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and pulmonary hypertension. Finally, current gaps in knowledge and areas of ongoing investigation in lung pericyte biology are also discussed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: While schizophrenia differs between males and females in the age of onset, symptomatology, and disease course, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain uncharacterized. {METHODS}: To address questions about the sex-specific effects of schizophrenia, we performed a large-scale transcriptome analysis of {RNA} sequencing data from 437 controls and 341 cases from two distinct cohorts from the {CommonMind} Consortium. {RESULTS}: Analysis across the cohorts identified a reproducible gene expression signature of schizophrenia that was highly concordant with previous work. Differential expression across sex was reproducible across cohorts and identified X- and Y-linked genes, as well as those involved in dosage compensation. Intriguingly, the sex expression signature was also enriched for genes involved in neurexin family protein binding and synaptic organization. Differential expression analysis testing a sex-by-diagnosis interaction effect did not identify any genome-wide signature after multiple testing corrections. Gene coexpression network analysis was performed to reduce dimensionality from thousands of genes to dozens of modules and elucidate interactions among genes. We found enrichment of coexpression modules for sex-by-diagnosis differential expression signatures, which were highly reproducible across the two cohorts and involved a number of diverse pathways, including neural nucleus development, neuron projection morphogenesis, and regulation of neural precursor cell proliferation. {CONCLUSIONS}: Overall, our results indicate that the effect size of sex differences in schizophrenia gene expression signatures is small and underscore the challenge of identifying robust sex-by-diagnosis signatures, which will require future analyses in larger cohorts.

Previous evidence for shared genetic risk and sex differences in brain abnormalities across disorders suggest possible shared sex-dependent genetic risk. {METHODS}: We conducted the largest to date genome-wide genotype-by-sex (G×S) interaction of risk for these disorders using 85,735 cases (33,403 {SCZ}, 19,924 {BIP}, and 32,408 {MDD}) and 109,946 controls from the {PGC} (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) and {iPSYCH}. {RESULTS}: Across disorders, genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphism-by-sex interaction was detected for a locus encompassing {NKAIN}2 (rs117780815, p = 3.2 × 10-8), which interacts with sodium/potassium-transporting {ATPase} (adenosine triphosphatase) enzymes, implicating neuronal excitability. Three additional loci showed evidence (p {\textbackslash}textless 1 × 10-6) for cross-disorder G×S interaction (rs7302529, p = 1.6 × 10-7; rs73033497, p = 8.8 × 10-7; rs7914279, p = 6.4 × 10-7), implicating various functions. Gene-based analyses identified G×S interaction across disorders (p = 8.97 × 10-7) with transcriptional inhibitor {SLTM}. Most significant in {SCZ} was a {MOCOS} gene locus (rs11665282, p = 1.5 × 10-7), implicating vascular endothelial cells. Secondary analysis of the {PGC}-{SCZ} dataset detected an interaction (rs13265509, p = 1.1 × 10-7) in a locus containing {IDO}2, a kynurenine pathway enzyme with immunoregulatory functions implicated in {SCZ}, {BIP}, and {MDD}. Pathway enrichment analysis detected significant G×S interaction of genes regulating vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling in {MDD} (false discovery rate-corrected p {\textbackslash}textless .05). {CONCLUSIONS}: In the largest genome-wide G×S analysis of mood and psychotic disorders to date, there was substantial genetic overlap between the sexes.

In the absence of the {APOE}-epsilon4 allele, the cumulative risks of {AD} to age 90 years, adjusted for education and sex, were 4 times higher for African Americans ({RR}, 4.4; 95\% {CI}, 2.3-8.6) and 2 times higher for Hispanics ({RR}, 2.3; 95\% {CI}, 1.2-4.3) than for whites. In the presence of an {APOE}-epsilon4 allele, the cumulative risk of {AD} to age 90 years was similar for individuals in all 3 ethnic groups. {CONCLUSION}: The presence of an {APOE}-epsilon4 allele is a determinant of {AD} risk in whites, but African Americans and Hispanics have an increased frequency of {AD} regardless of their {APOE} genotype. These results suggest that other genes or risk factors may contribute to the increased risk of {AD} in African Americans and Hispanics.},

Fibroblasts are heterogeneous cells, encompassing functionally distinct populations, the phenotypes of which differ according to their tissue of origin and type of inciting disease. Their immunological properties are also diverse, ranging from the maintenance of a potent inflammatory environment in chronic inflammation to promoting immunosuppression in malignancy, and encapsulating and incarcerating infectious agents within tissues. In this Review, we compare the mechanisms by which fibroblasts control local immune responses, as well as the factors regulating their inflammatory and suppressive profiles, in different tissues and pathological settings. This cross-disease perspective highlights the importance of tissue context in determining fibroblast-immune cell interactions, as well as potential therapeutic avenues to exploit this knowledge for the benefit of patients with chronic infection, inflammation and cancer. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) is a common and widespread biological assay, and an increasing amount of data is generated with it. In practice, there are a large number of individual steps a researcher must perform before raw {RNA}-seq reads yield directly valuable information, such as differential gene expression data. Existing software tools are typically specialized, only performing one step-such as alignment of reads to a reference genome-of a larger workflow. The demand for a more comprehensive and reproducible workflow has led to the production of a number of publicly available {RNA}-seq pipelines. However, we have found that most require computational expertise to set up or share among several users, are not actively maintained, or lack features we have found to be important in our own analyses. {RESULTS}: In response to these concerns, we have developed a Scalable Pipeline for Expression Analysis and Quantification ({SPEAQeasy}), which is easy to install and share, and provides a bridge towards R/Bioconductor downstream analysis solutions. {SPEAQeasy} is portable across computational frameworks ({SGE}, {SLURM}, local, docker integration) and different configuration files are provided ( http://research.libd.org/{SPEAQeasy}/ ). {CONCLUSIONS}: {SPEAQeasy} is user-friendly and lowers the computational-domain entry barrier for biologists and clinicians to {RNA}-seq data processing as the main input file is a table with sample names and their corresponding {FASTQ} files. The goal is to provide a flexible pipeline that is immediately usable by researchers, regardless of their technical background or computing environment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease currently affecting 1.75\% of the {US} population, with projected growth to 3.46\% by 2050. Identifying common genetic variants driving differences in transcript expression that confer {AD} risk is necessary to elucidate {AD} mechanism and develop therapeutic interventions. We modify the {FUSION} transcriptome-wide association study ({TWAS}) pipeline to ingest gene expression values from multiple neocortical regions. {METHODS}: A combined dataset of 2003 genotypes clustered to 1000 Genomes individuals from Utah with Northern and Western European ancestry ({CEU}) was used to construct a training set of 790 genotypes paired to 888 {RNASeq} profiles from temporal cortex ({TCX} = 248), prefrontal cortex ({FP} = 50), inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG} = 41), superior temporal gyrus ({STG} = 34), parahippocampal cortex ({PHG} = 34), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC} = 461). Following within-tissue normalization and covariate adjustment, predictive weights to impute expression components based on a gene's surrounding cis-variants were trained. The {FUSION} pipeline was modified to support input of pre-scaled expression values and support cross validation with a repeated measure design arising from the presence of multiple transcriptome samples from the same individual across different tissues. {RESULTS}: Cis-variant architecture alone was informative to train weights and impute expression for 6780 (49.67\%) autosomal genes, the majority of which significantly correlated with gene expression; {FDR} {\textbackslash}textless 5\%: N = 6775 (99.92\%), Bonferroni: N = 6716 (99.06\%). Validation of weights in 515 matched genotype to {RNASeq} profiles from the {CommonMind} Consortium ({CMC}) was (72.14\%) in {DLPFC} profiles. Association of imputed expression components from all 2003 genotype profiles yielded 8 genes significantly associated with {AD} ({FDR} {\textbackslash}textless 0.05): {APOC}1, {EED}, {CD}2AP, {CEACAM}19, {CLPTM}1, {MTCH}2, {TREM}2, and {KNOP}1. {CONCLUSIONS}: We provide evidence of cis-genetic variation conferring {AD} risk through 8 genes across six distinct genomic loci. Moreover, we provide expression weights for 6780 genes as a valuable resource to the community, which can be abstracted across the neocortex and a wide range of neuronal phenotypes.},

	abstract = {When assessed over a large number of samples, bulk {RNA} sequencing provides reliable data for gene expression at the tissue level. Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) deepens those analyses by evaluating gene expression at the cellular level. Both data types lend insights into disease etiology. With current technologies, {scRNA}-seq data are known to be noisy. Constrained by costs, {scRNA}-seq data are typically generated from a relatively small number of subjects, which limits their utility for some analyses, such as identification of gene expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}). To address these issues while maintaining the unique advantages of each data type, we develop a Bayesian method ({bMIND}) to integrate bulk and {scRNA}-seq data. With a prior derived from {scRNA}-seq data, we propose to estimate sample-level cell type-specific ({CTS}) expression from bulk expression data. The {CTS} expression enables large-scale sample-level downstream analyses, such as detection of {CTS} differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}) and {eQTLs}. Through simulations, we show that {bMIND} improves the accuracy of sample-level {CTS} expression estimates and increases the power to discover {CTS} {DEGs} when compared to existing methods. To further our understanding of two complex phenotypes, autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease, we apply {bMIND} to gene expression data of relevant brain tissue to identify {CTS} {DEGs}. Our results complement findings for {CTS} {DEGs} obtained from {snRNA}-seq studies, replicating certain {DEGs} in specific cell types while nominating other novel genes for those cell types. Finally, we calculate {CTS} {eQTLs} for 11 brain regions by analyzing Genotype-Tissue Expression Project data, creating a new resource for biological insights. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021 Wang et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

We demonstrate {scPhere} on nine large datasets in complex tissue from human patients or animal development.

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: Racial/ethnic disparities in health care use and clinical outcomes for behavioral health disorders, including psychosis, are well documented, but less is known about these disparities during the period leading up to first-episode psychosis ({FEP}). {OBJECTIVE}: To describe the racial/ethnic disparities in behavioral health care use and prescription drug use of children and young adults before the diagnosis of {FEP}. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: An observational cohort study was conducted using medical and prescription drug claims from January 1, 2007, to September 30, 2015, obtained from Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database, a commercial claims database augmented with race/ethnicity and socioeconomic variables. Data analysis was performed from February 6, 2018, to October 10, 2020. First-episode psychosis was determined by the presence of psychosis diagnoses on claims for at least 1 hospitalization or 2 outpatient events, with a continuous enrollment requirement of at least 2 years before the first diagnosis. Participants included 3017 Black, Hispanic, or White patients who were continually enrolled in commercial insurance plans and received an {FEP} diagnosis between the ages of 10 and 21 years. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Race/ethnicity was determined from a commercial claims database. Rates of inpatient admission, emergency department presentation, and outpatient visits (including psychotherapy), behavioral health disorder diagnoses, and antipsychotic/antidepressant prescription fills were determined for the year before {FEP}. Race/ethnicity was also obtained from Optum's claims database. With use of multivariable logistic regression, results were adjusted for covariates including estimated household income, age, sex, and geographic division in the {US}. {RESULTS}: Of the 3017 patients with {FEP}, 643 Black or Hispanic patients (343 [53.3\%] Black, 300 [46.7\%] Hispanic, 324 [50.4\%] male, mean [{SD}] age, 17.2 [2.76] years) were less likely than 2374 White patients (1210 [51.0\%] male, mean age, 17.0 [2.72] years) to receive comorbid behavioral health disorder diagnoses in the year before the diagnosis of {FEP} (410 [63.8\%] vs 1806 [76.1\%], {\textbackslash}chi2 = 39.3; P {\textbackslash}textless .001). Except for emergency care, behavioral health care use rates were lower in Black and Hispanic patients vs White patients (424 [65.9\%] vs 1868 [78.7\%]; {\textbackslash}chi2 = 45.0; P {\textbackslash}textless .001), particularly for outpatient visits with behavioral health care professionals (232 [36.1\%] vs 1236 [52.1\%]; {\textbackslash}chi2 = 51.7; P {\textbackslash}textless .001). After adjustment for socioeconomic covariates, behavioral health care use rates (68.9\% vs 79.2\%; P {\textbackslash}textless .001), outpatient visits with behavioral health professionals (37.7\% vs 51.2\%; P {\textbackslash}textless .001), and other outcomes remained significantly lower for Black and Hispanic patients vs White patients. {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: The results of this study extend existing research findings of well-known racial/ethnic disparities in the population of patients who are diagnosed with {FEP}. These differences were apparent in young patients with continuous commercial health insurance and after controlling for household income. Providing equal access to preventive outpatient behavioral health care may increase opportunities for timely detection of psychotic symptoms and early intervention and improve differential outcomes after {FEP}.},

We apply our procedure to a {CITE}-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19).

The development of algorithms inferring regulatory interactions from functional genomics data has been an active area of research. With the advent of single-cell {RNA}-seq data ({scRNA}-seq), numerous methods specifically designed to take advantage of single-cell datasets have been proposed. However, published benchmarks on single-cell network inference are mostly based on simulated data. Once applied to real data, these benchmarks take into account only a small set of genes and only compare the inferred networks with an imposed ground-truth. Here, we benchmark six single-cell network inference methods based on their reproducibility, i.e., their ability to infer similar networks when applied to two independent datasets for the same biological condition. We tested each of these methods on real data from three biological conditions: human retina, T-cells in colorectal cancer, and human hematopoiesis. Once taking into account networks with up to 100,000 links, {GENIE}3 results to be the most reproducible algorithm and, together with {GRNBoost}2, show higher intersection with ground-truth biological interactions. These results are independent from the single-cell sequencing platform, the cell type annotation system and the number of cells constituting the dataset. Finally, {GRNBoost}2 and {CLR} show more reproducible performance once a more stringent thresholding is applied to the networks (1,000-100 links).

However, interpreting what genetic differences imply about their phenotypic differences remains challenging. Here, we introduce an approach for identifying divergent gene regulation between archaic hominins, such as Neanderthals, and {AMH} sequences, and find 766 genes that are likely to have been divergently regulated ({DR}) by Neanderthal haplotypes that do not remain in {AMHs}. {DR} genes include many involved in phenotypes known to differ between Neanderthals and {AMHs}, such as the structure of the rib cage and supraorbital ridge development. They are also enriched for genes associated with spontaneous abortion, polycystic ovary syndrome, myocardial infarction and melanoma. Phenotypes associated with modern human variation in these genes' regulation in ∼23,000 biobank patients further support their involvement in immune and cardiovascular phenotypes. Comparing {DR} genes between two Neanderthals and a Denisovan revealed divergence in the immune system and in genes associated with skeletal and dental morphology that are consistent with the archaeological record. These results establish differences in gene regulatory architecture between {AMHs} and archaic hominins, and provide an avenue for exploring phenotypic differences between archaic groups from genomic information alone.},

	abstract = {Although {SARS}-{CoV}-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, patients with and survivors of {COVID}-19 can suffer neurological symptoms1-3. However, an unbiased understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that are affected in the brains of patients with {COVID}-19 is missing. Here we profile 65,309 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 30 frontal cortex and choroid plexus samples across 14 control individuals (including 1 patient with terminal influenza) and 8 patients with {COVID}-19. Although our systematic analysis yields no molecular traces of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in the brain, we observe broad cellular perturbations indicating that barrier cells of the choroid plexus sense and relay peripheral inflammation into the brain and show that peripheral T cells infiltrate the parenchyma. We discover microglia and astrocyte subpopulations associated with {COVID}-19 that share features with pathological cell states that have previously been reported in human neurodegenerative disease4-6. Synaptic signalling of upper-layer excitatory neurons-which are evolutionarily expanded in humans7 and linked to cognitive function8-is preferentially affected in {COVID}-19. Across cell types, perturbations associated with {COVID}-19 overlap with those found in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognition, schizophrenia and depression. Our findings and public dataset provide a molecular framework to understand current observations of {COVID}-19-related neurological disease, and any such disease that may emerge at a later date. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

	abstract = {{FST} and kinship are key parameters often estimated in modern population genetics studies in order to quantitatively characterize structure and relatedness. Kinship matrices have also become a fundamental quantity used in genome-wide association studies and heritability estimation. The most frequently-used estimators of {FST} and kinship are method-of-moments estimators whose accuracies depend strongly on the existence of simple underlying forms of structure, such as the independent subpopulations model of non-overlapping, independently evolving subpopulations. However, modern data sets have revealed that these simple models of structure likely do not hold in many populations, including humans. In this work, we analyze the behavior of these estimators in the presence of arbitrarily-complex population structures, which results in an improved estimation framework specifically designed for arbitrary population structures. After generalizing the definition of {FST} to arbitrary population structures and establishing a framework for assessing bias and consistency of genome-wide estimators, we calculate the accuracy of existing {FST} and kinship estimators under arbitrary population structures, characterizing biases and estimation challenges unobserved under their originally-assumed models of structure. We then present our new approach, which consistently estimates kinship and {FST} when the minimum kinship value in the dataset is estimated consistently. We illustrate our results using simulated genotypes from an admixture model, constructing a one-dimensional geographic scenario that departs nontrivially from the independent subpopulations model. Our simulations reveal the potential for severe biases in estimates of existing approaches that are overcome by our new framework. This work may significantly improve future analyses that rely on accurate kinship and {FST} estimates.},

	abstract = {The Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) project provides a valuable resource of large-scale gene expressions across multiple tissue types. Under various technical noise and unknown or unmeasured factors, how to robustly estimate the major tissue effect becomes challenging. Moreover, different genes exhibit heterogeneous expressions across different tissue types. Therefore, we need a robust method which adapts to the heterogeneities of gene expressions to improve the estimation for the tissue effect. We followed the approach of the robust estimation based on {\textbackslash}gamma-density-power-weight in the works of Fujisawa, H. and Eguchi, S. (2008). Robust parameter estimation with a small bias against heavy contamination. J. Multivariate Anal. 99: 2053-2081 and Windham, M.P. (1995). Robustifying model fitting. J. Roy. Stat. Soc. B: 599-609, where {\textbackslash}gamma is the exponent of density weight which controls the balance between bias and variance. As far as we know, our work is the first to propose a procedure to tune the parameter {\textbackslash}gamma to balance the bias-variance trade-off under the mixture models. We constructed a robust likelihood criterion based on weighted densities in the mixture model of Gaussian population distribution mixed with unknown outlier distribution, and developed a data-adaptive {\textbackslash}gamma-selection procedure embedded into the robust estimation. We provided a heuristic analysis on the selection criterion and found that our practical selection trend under various {\textbackslash}gamma's in average performance has similar capability to capture minimizer {\textbackslash}gamma as the inestimable mean squared error ({MSE}) trend from our simulation studies under a series of settings. Our data-adaptive robustifying procedure in the linear regression problem ({AdaReg}) showed a significant advantage in both simulation studies and real data application in estimating tissue effect of heart samples from the {GTEx} project, compared to the fixed {\textbackslash}gamma procedure and other robust methods. At the end, the paper discussed some limitations on this method and future work. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021 Walter de Gruyter {GmbH}, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: A feature selection algorithm may select the subset of features with the best associations with the class labels. The recursive feature elimination ({RFE}) is a heuristic feature screening framework and has been widely used to select the biological {OMIC} biomarkers. This study proposed a dynamic recursive feature elimination ({dRFE}) framework with more flexible feature elimination operations. The proposed {dRFE} was comprehensively compared with 11 existing feature selection algorithms and five classifiers on the eight difficult transcriptome datasets from a previous study, the ten newly collected transcriptome datasets and the five methylome datasets. {RESULTS}: The experimental data suggested that the regular {RFE} framework did not perform well, and {dRFE} outperformed the existing feature selection algorithms in most cases. The {dRFE}-detected features achieved Acc = 1.0000 for the two methylome datasets {GSE}53045 and {GSE}66695. The best prediction accuracies of the {dRFE}-detected features were 0.9259, 0.9424 and 0.8601 for the other three methylome datasets {GSE}74845, {GSE}103186 and {GSE}80970, respectively. Four transcriptome datasets received Acc = 1.0000 using the {dRFE}-detected features, and the prediction accuracies for the other six newly collected transcriptome datasets were between 0.6301 and 0.9917. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The experiments in this study are implemented and tested using the programming language Python version 3.7.6. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: High-throughput bio-{OMIC} technologies are producing high-dimension data from bio-samples at an ever increasing rate, whereas the training sample number in a traditional experiment remains small due to various difficulties. This "large p, small n" paradigm in the area of biomedical "big data" may be at least partly solved by feature selection algorithms, which select only features significantly associated with phenotypes. Feature selection is an {NP}-hard problem. Due to the exponentially increased time requirement for finding the globally optimal solution, all the existing feature selection algorithms employ heuristic rules to find locally optimal solutions, and their solutions achieve different performances on different datasets. {RESULTS}: This work describes a feature selection algorithm based on a recently published correlation measurement, Maximal Information Coefficient ({MIC}). The proposed algorithm, {McTwo}, aims to select features associated with phenotypes, independently of each other, and achieving high classification performance of the nearest neighbor algorithm. Based on the comparative study of 17 datasets, {McTwo} performs about as well as or better than existing algorithms, with significantly reduced numbers of selected features. The features selected by {McTwo} also appear to have particular biomedical relevance to the phenotypes from the literature. {CONCLUSION}: {McTwo} selects a feature subset with very good classification performance, as well as a small feature number. So {McTwo} may represent a complementary feature selection algorithm for the high-dimensional biomedical datasets.},

	abstract = {Xanthomonadales comprises one of the largest phytopathogenic bacterial groups, and is currently classified within the gamma-proteobacteria. However, the phylogenetic placement of this group is not clearly resolved, and the results of different studies contradict one another. In this work, the evolutionary position of Xanthomonadales was determined by analyzing the presence of shared insertions and deletions ({INDELs}) in highly conserved proteins. Several distinctive insertions found in most of the members of the gamma-proteobacteria are absent in Xanthomonadales and groups such as Legionelalles, Chromatiales, Methylococcales, Thiotrichales and Cardiobacteriales. These {INDELs} were most likely introduced after the branching of Xanthomonadales from most of the gamma-proteobacteria and provide evidence for the phylogenetic placement of the early gamma-proteobacteria. Moreover, other proteins contain insertions exclusive to the Xanthomonadales order, confirming that this is a monophyletic group and provide important specific genetic markers. Thus, the data presented clearly support the Xanthomonadales group as an independent subdivision, and constitute one of the deepest branching lineage within the gamma-proteobacteria clade.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Several links have been established between the human gut microbiome and conditions such as obesity and inflammatory bowel syndrome. This highlights the importance of understanding what properties of the gut microbiome can affect the health of the human host. Studies have been undertaken to determine the species composition of this microbiome and infer functional profiles associated with such host properties. However, lateral gene transfer ({LGT}) between community members may result in misleading taxonomic attributions for the recipient organisms, thus making species-function links difficult to establish. {RESULTS}: We identified a peptides/nickel transport complex whose components differed in abundance based upon levels of host obesity, and assigned the encoded proteins to members of the microbial community. Each protein was assigned to several distinct taxonomic groups, with moderate levels of agreement observed among different proteins in the complex. Phylogenetic trees of these proteins produced clusters that differed greatly from taxonomic attributions and indicated that habitat-directed {LGT} of this complex is likely to have occurred, though not always between the same partners. {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings demonstrate that certain membrane transport systems may be an important factor within an obese-associated gut microbiome and that such complexes may be acquired several times by different strains of the same species. Additionally, an example of individual proteins from different organisms being transferred into one operon was observed, potentially demonstrating a functional complex despite the donors of the subunits being taxonomically disparate. Our results also highlight the potential impact of habitat-directed {LGT} on the resident microbiota.},

The scenario derived from this analysis and other recently published reports reflect the confounding effects on bacterial phylogenomics of past and present {HGT}.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Rh50 proteins belong to the family of ammonia permeases together with their Amt/{MEP} homologs. Ammonia permeases increase the permeability of {NH}3/{NH}4+ across cell membranes and are believed to be involved in excretion of toxic ammonia and in the maintenance of {pH} homeostasis. {RH}50 genes are widespread in eukaryotes but absent in land plants and fungi, and remarkably rare in prokaryotes. The evolutionary history of {RH}50 genes in prokaryotes is just beginning to be unveiled. {RESULTS}: Here, a molecular phylogenetic approach suggests horizontal gene transfer ({HGT}) as a primary force driving the evolution and spread of {RH}50 among prokaryotes. In addition, the taxonomic distribution of the {RH}50 gene among prokaryotes turned out to be very narrow; a single-copy {RH}50 is present in the genome of only a small proportion of Bacteria, and, first evidence to date, in only three methanogens among Euryarchaea. The coexistence of {RH}50 and {AMT} in prokaryotes seems also a rare event. Finally, phylogenetic analyses were used to reconstruct the {HGT} network along which prokaryotic {RH}50 evolution has taken place. {CONCLUSIONS}: The eukaryotic or bacterial "origin" of the {RH}50 gene remains unsolved. The {RH}50 prokaryotic {HGT} network suggests a preferential directionality of transfer from aerobic to anaerobic organisms. The observed {HGT} events between archaeal methanogens, anaerobic and aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria suggest that syntrophic relationships play a major role in the structuring of the network, and point to oxygen minimum zones as an ecological niche that might be of crucial importance for {HGT}-driven evolution.},

	abstract = {Antipsychotic drugs are one of the largest types of prescribed drugs and have large inter-individual differences in efficacy, but there is no methodology to predict their clinical effect. Here we show a four-gene blood expression profile to predict the response to antipsychotics in schizophrenia patients before treatment. We sequenced total {mRNA} from blood samples of antipsychotic naïve patients who, after 3 months of treatment, were in the top 40\% with the best response (15 patients) and in the bottom 40\% with the worst response (15 patients) according to the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ({BPRS}). We characterized the transcriptome before treatment of these 30 patients and found 130 genes with significant differential expression (Padj value {\textbackslash}textless 0.01) associated with clinical response. Then, we used Random Forests, an ensemble learning method for classification and regression, to obtain a list of predictor genes. The expression of four genes can predict the response to antipsychotic medication with a cross-validation accuracy estimation of 0.83 and an area under the curve of 0.97 using a logistic regression. We anticipate that this approach is a gateway to select the specific antipsychotic that will produce the best response to treatment for each specific patient.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although much progress has been made on antipsychotic drug development, precise mechanisms behind the action of typical and atypical antipsychotics are poorly understood. {METHODS}: We performed genome-wide expression profiling to study effects of typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics in the postmortem liver of schizophrenia patients using microarrays (Affymetrix U133 plus2.0). We classified the subjects into typical antipsychotics (n = 24) or atypical antipsychotics (n = 26) based on their medication history, and compared gene expression profiles with unaffected controls (n = 34). We further analyzed individual antipsychotic effects on gene expression by sub-classifying the subjects into four major antipsychotic groups including haloperidol, phenothiazines, olanzapine and risperidone. {RESULTS}: Typical antipsychotics affected genes associated with nuclear protein, stress responses and phosphorylation, whereas atypical antipsychotics affected genes associated with golgi/endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm transport. Comparison between typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics further identified genes associated with lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function. Analyses on individual antipsychotics revealed a set of genes (151 transcripts, {FDR} adjusted p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) that are differentially regulated by four antipsychotics, particularly by phenothiazines, in the liver of schizophrenia patients. {CONCLUSION}: Typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics affect different genes and biological function in the liver. Typical antipsychotic phenothiazines exert robust effects on gene expression in the liver that may lead to liver toxicity. The genes found in the current study may benefit antipsychotic drug development with better therapeutic and side effect profiles.},

Both the schizophreniform and the chronic schizophrenic patients had significantly larger cerebral ventricles than did the other psychiatric or control subjects. Ventricular size in the patients with affective disorder was not significantly different than in any of the other groups. Twenty percent of the schizophreniform patients had enlarged ventricles, (ventricular-brain ratio, greater than 10). The only other subjects outside this limit were four chronic schizophrenic patients (24\%). Five schizophreniform patients and three with affective disorder had evidence of mild cortical atrophy. The results suggest that, in some schizophrenic patients, ventricular enlargement and less frequently cortical atrophy predate the onset of psychoses and are not a result of psychiatric treatment.},

Nonetheless, molecular signatures in neuronal tissues that associate with deficits are not well understood. We conducted nasal biopsy to obtain olfactory epithelium from patients with {SZ} and control subjects. The neural layers from the biopsied epithelium were enriched by laser-captured microdissection. We then performed an unbiased microarray expression study and implemented a systematic neuropsychological assessment on the same participants. The differentially regulated genes in {SZ} were further filtered based on correlation with neuropsychological traits. This strategy identified the {SMAD} 5 gene, and real-time quantitative {PCR} analysis also supports downregulation of the {SMAD} pathway in {SZ}. The {SMAD} pathway has been important in multiple tissues, including the role for neurodevelopment and bone formation. Here the involvement of the pathway in adult brain function is suggested. This exploratory study establishes a strategy to better identify neuronal molecular signatures that are potentially associated with mental illness and cognitive deficits. We propose that the {SMAD} pathway may be a novel target in addressing cognitive deficit of {SZ} in future studies.},

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

We sought to further our understanding of the relationship between brain tropism, neuro-inflammation, and host immune response in acute {COVID}-19 cases. {METHODS}: Three brain regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medulla oblongata, and choroid plexus) from 5 patients with severe {COVID}-19 and 4 controls were examined. The presence of the virus was assessed by western blot against viral spike protein, as well as viral transcriptome analysis covering {\textbackslash}textgreater 99\% of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genome and all potential serotypes. Droplet-based single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing ({snRNA}-seq) was performed in the same samples to examine the impact of {COVID}-19 on transcription in individual cells of the brain. {RESULTS}: Quantification of viral spike S1 protein and viral transcripts did not detect {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in the postmortem brain tissue. However, analysis of 68,557 single-nucleus transcriptomes from three distinct regions of the brain identified an increased proportion of stromal cells, monocytes, and macrophages in the choroid plexus of {COVID}-19 patients.

	abstract = {It is important to study the genetics of complex traits in diverse populations. Here, we introduce covariate-adjusted linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) score regression (cov-{LDSC}), a method to estimate {SNP}-heritability (\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbf\{2\}\}){\textbackslash} and its enrichment in homogenous and admixed populations with summary statistics and in-sample {LD} estimates. In-sample {LD} can be estimated from a subset of the genome-wide association studies samples, allowing our method to be applied efficiently to very large cohorts. In simulations, we show that unadjusted {LDSC} underestimates \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbf\{2\}\}{\textbackslash} by 10-60\% in admixed populations; in contrast, cov-{LDSC} is robustly accurate. We apply cov-{LDSC} to genotyping data from 8124 individuals, mostly of admixed ancestry, from the Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas study, and to approximately 161 000 Latino-ancestry individuals, 47 000 African American-ancestry individuals and 135 000 European-ancestry individuals, as classified by 23andMe. We estimate \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbf\{2\}\}{\textbackslash} and detect heritability enrichment in three quantitative and five dichotomous phenotypes, making this, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive heritability-based analysis of admixed individuals to date. Most traits have high concordance of \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbf\{2\}\}{\textbackslash} and consistent tissue-specific heritability enrichment among different populations. However, for age at menarche, we observe population-specific heritability estimates of \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashboldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashmathbf\{2\}\}{\textbackslash}. We observe consistent patterns of tissue-specific heritability enrichment across populations; for example, in the limbic system for {BMI}, the per-standardized-annotation effect size {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}textbackslashtau {\textbackslash}* is 0.16 ± 0.04, 0.28 ± 0.11 and 0.18 ± 0.03 in the Latino-, African American- and European-ancestry populations, respectively. Our approach is a powerful way to analyze genetic data for complex traits from admixed populations. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.},

	abstract = {Transcriptome-wide association studies ({TWAS}), which aim to detect relationships between gene expression and a phenotype, are commonly used for secondary analysis of genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) results. Results of {TWAS} analyses are often interpreted as indicating a genetically mediated relationship between gene expression and the phenotype, but because the traditional {TWAS} framework does not model the uncertainty in the expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) effect estimates, this interpretation is not justified. In this study we outline the implications of this issue. Using simulations, we show severely inflated type 1 error rates for {TWAS} when evaluating a null hypothesis of no genetic relationship between gene expression and the phenotype. Moreover, in our application to real data only 51\% of the {TWAS} associations were confirmed with local genetic correlation analysis, an approach which correctly evaluates the same null. Our results thus demonstrate that {TWAS} is unsuitable for investigating genetic relationships between gene expression and a phenotype.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Genomic studies increasingly integrate expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) information into their analysis pipelines, but few tools exist for the visualization of colocalization between {eQTL} and {GWAS} results. Those tools that do exist are limited in their analysis options, and do not integrate {eQTL} and {GWAS} information into a single figure panel, making the visualization of colocalization difficult. {RESULTS}: To address this issue, we developed the intuitive and user-friendly R package {eQTpLot}. {eQTpLot} takes as input standard {GWAS} and cis-{eQTL} summary statistics, and optional pairwise {LD} information, to generate a series of plots visualizing colocalization, correlation, and enrichment between {eQTL} and {GWAS} signals for a given gene-trait pair. With {eQTpLot}, investigators can easily generate a series of customizable plots clearly illustrating, for a given gene-trait pair: 1) colocalization between {GWAS} and {eQTL} signals, 2) correlation between {GWAS} and {eQTL} p-values, 3) enrichment of {eQTLs} among trait-significant variants, 4) the {LD} landscape of the locus in question, and 5) the relationship between the direction of effect of {eQTL} signals and the direction of effect of colocalizing {GWAS} peaks. These clear and comprehensive plots provide a unique view of {eQTL}-{GWAS} colocalization, allowing for a more complete understanding of the interaction between gene expression and trait associations. {CONCLUSIONS}: {eQTpLot} provides a unique, user-friendly, and intuitive means of visualizing {eQTL} and {GWAS} signal colocalization, incorporating novel features not found in other {eQTL} visualization software. We believe {eQTpLot} will prove a useful tool for investigators seeking a convenient and customizable visualization of {eQTL} and {GWAS} data colocalization. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: the {eQTpLot} R package and tutorial are available at https://github.com/{RitchieLab}/{eQTpLot}. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

	abstract = {Trait-associated genetic variants affect complex phenotypes primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the {eQTLGen} Consortium. We detected cis-{eQTL} for 88\% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-{eQTL} (detected for 37\% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell {RNA}-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-{eQTL}. Trans-{eQTL} exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13\% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large {eQTL} resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

	abstract = {Neurodevelopmental disorders are classified as diseases that cause abnormal functions of the brain or central nervous system. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders show impaired language and speech abilities, learning and memory damage, and poor motor skills. However, we still know very little about the molecular etiology of these disorders. Recent evidence implicates the bromodomain-containing proteins ({BCPs}) in the initiation and development of neurodevelopmental disorders. {BCPs} have a particular domain, the bromodomain (Brd), which was originally identified as specifically binding acetyl-lysine residues at the N-terminus of histone proteins in vitro and in vivo. Other domains of {BCPs} are responsible for binding partner proteins to form regulatory complexes. Once these complexes are assembled, {BCPs} alter chromosomal states and regulate gene expression. Some {BCP} complexes bind nucleosomes, are involved in basal transcription regulation, and influence the transcription of many genes. However, most {BCPs} are involved in targeting. For example, some {BCPs} function as a recruitment platform or scaffold through their Brds-binding targeting sites. Others are recruited to form a complex to bind the targeting sites of their partners. The regulation mediated by these proteins is especially critical during normal and abnormal development. Mutant {BCPs} or dysfunctional {BCP}-containing complexes are implicated in the initiation and development of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the pathogenic molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this review, we focus on the roles of regulatory {BCPs} associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including mental retardation, Fragile X syndrome ({FRX}), Williams syndrome ({WS}), Rett syndrome and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome ({RTS}). A better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis, based upon the roles of {BCPs}, will lead to screening of targets for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.},

Common {SNPs} located in or near {BNIP}3L were found to be genome-wide significantly associated with schizophrenia in recent genome-wide association studies. The purpose of our study is to investigate potential causal variants in {BNIP}3L gene. {RESULTS}: We performed targeted sequencing for all exons and un-translated regions of {BNIP}3L gene among 1806 patients with schizophrenia and 998 healthy controls of Han Chinese origin. Three rare nonsynonymous mutations, {BNIP}3L ({NM}\_004331): c.52A{\textbackslash}{textgreaterG}, c.167G{\textbackslash}{textgreaterA} and c.313A{\textbackslash}{textgreaterT}, were identified in schizophrenia cases, and two of them were newly reported. The frequencies of these rare nonsynonymous mutations were significantly different between schizophrenia cases and healthy controls. For the common variants, rs147389989 achieved significance in both allelic and genotypic distributions with schizophrenia. Rs1042992 and rs17310286 were significantly associated with schizophrenia in meta-analyses using {PGC}, {CLOZUK}, and our new datasets in this study. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our findings provided further evidence that {BNIP}3L gene is a susceptibility gene of schizophrenia and revealed functional and potential causal mutations in {BNIP}3L.

Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we have surveyed {DNAm} in 344 samples of human postmortem brain tissue from neurotypical subjects and individuals with schizophrenia. We identify genetic influence on local methylation levels throughout the genome, both at {CpG} sites and {CpH} sites, with 86\% of {SNPs} and 55\% of {CpGs} being part of methylation quantitative trait loci ({meQTLs}). These associations can further be clustered into regions that are differentially methylated by a given {SNP}, highlighting the genes and regions with which these loci are epigenetically associated. These findings can be used to better characterize schizophrenia {GWAS}-identified variants as epigenetic risk variants. Regions differentially methylated by schizophrenia risk-{SNPs} explain much of the heritability associated with risk loci, despite covering only a fraction of the genomic space. We provide a comprehensive, single base resolution view of association between genetic variation and genomic methylation, and implicate schizophrenia {GWAS}-associated variants as influencing the epigenetic plasticity of the brain. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: In the {US}, dementia risk is higher in non-Hispanic Black individuals than in non-Hispanic White individuals. To evaluate progress toward reducing such disparities, tracking secular trends in racial disparities in dementia prevalence is essential. {OBJECTIVE}: To examine whether relative racial disparities in dementia prevalence or incidence have changed in the {US} from 2000 to 2016. {DESIGN}, {SETTINGS}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: The Health and Retirement Study ({HRS}) is a nationally representative study of adults 50 years or older. New participants are recruited every 6 years, and study visits occur biennially. Approximately 17 000 to 22 000 respondents have been surveyed at each wave since 2000, achieving response rates of 81\% to 89\%. Data for this cohort study were obtained from non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black participants aged 70 years and older from the 2000 to 2016 waves. For analyses of secular trends in racial disparities in dementia prevalence, each {HRS} wave was considered separately (range of participants meeting eligibility criteria in each wave, 6322-7579). For analyses of secular trends in racial disparities in dementia incidence, 7 subcohorts were created (range of participants meeting eligibility criteria in each subcohort, 5322-5961) following up people without dementia for 4 years from subcohort baseline visits in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Data were analyzed from October 2019 to August 2020. {EXPOSURES}: Race based on self-response to closed-ended survey questions. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Dementia status was determined using 3 algorithms with similar sensitivity and specificity across non-Hispanic White and Black participants. Disparities were characterized using ratio measures. {RESULTS}: In this study, the mean age and percentage of male participants eligible for inclusion in analyses of racial disparities in dementia prevalence increased over time among non-Hispanic White participants (from 78.2 years and 40\% in 2000 to 78.7 years and 44\% in 2016) but remained steady in non-Hispanic Black participants during the same period (from 78.0 years and 37\% in 2000 to 77.9 years and 38\% in 2016). Prevalence ratios comparing Black and White participants ranged from approximately 1.5 to 1.9 across algorithms and years, whereas hazard ratios ranged from approximately 1.4 to 1.8. Although results suggest stable or declining dementia risk overall, there was no evidence suggesting change in relative racial disparities in dementia prevalence or incidence during follow-up. {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: This study did not find evidence to suggest that the ratio of dementia risk across Black and White individuals changed in the {US} between 2000 and 2016. Additional efforts to identify and mitigate the source of these disparities is warranted.},

	abstract = {To infer the histories of population admixture, one important challenge with methods based on the admixture linkage disequilibrium ({ALD}) is to remove the effect of source {LD} ({SLD}), which is directly inherited from source populations. In previous methods, only the decay curve of weighted {LD} between pairs of sites whose genetic distance were larger than a certain starting distance was fitted by single or multiple exponential functions, for the inference of recent single- or multiple-wave admixture. However, the effect of {SLD} has not been well defined and no tool has been developed to estimate the effect of {SLD} on weighted {LD} decay. In this study, we defined the {SLD} in the formularized weighted {LD} statistic under the two-way admixture model and proposed a polynomial spectrum (p-spectrum) to study the weighted {SLD} and weighted {LD}. We also found that reference populations could be used to reduce the {SLD} in weighted {LD} statistics. We further developed a method, {iMAAPs}, to infer multiple-wave admixture by fitting {ALD} using a p-spectrum. We evaluated the performance of {iMAAPs} under various admixture models in simulated data and applied {iMAAPs} to the analysis of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from the Human Genome Diversity Project and the {HapMap} Project. We showed that {iMAAPs} is a considerable improvement over other current methods and further facilitates the inference of histories of complex population admixtures.},

	abstract = {Both schizophrenia ({SZ}) and bipolar disorder ({BD}) are highly heritable psychiatric disorders. The significant genomic risk loci are of great importance but with no guarantee of known functional impact and they cannot totally explain the genetic inheritance. In this study we present regional enrichment analyses across the genome, aiming to strike a balance between individual risk loci and integrated regional effects. Chromosomes were partitioned into 2 million base-pair regions (indicated by an underscore sign in the cytogenetic bands) on which enrichment tests are performed. In the discovery phase, we leverage the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium {SZ} and {BD} initial association test results for European Ancestry ({EA}) population and {dbGAP} {SNP} data for African Ancestry ({AA}) population. 78 and 48 regions show significantly enriched associations with {SZ} and {BD} respectively in the {EA} population, and nine are in common including {MHC}, 3p21.1, 7p22.3\_2, 2q32.3\_2, 8q24.3\_4, and 19q13.33\_1. The most unique {SZ} associated region is 1p21.3\_3, while the most unique {BD} associated region is 6q25.2\_1. For the {AA} population fewer regions are discovered with only 10\% overlapping with that of {EA} population. A replication test using Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data for {EA} population verified 9\% of the {SZ} enriched regions and 40\% of the {BD} enriched regions. In summary, we showed that regional enrichment analyses produce reliable genetic association profiles using about one tenth of samples compared to single base-pair genome wide association approach. The identified association regions will be useful for further genetic functional studies. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Computational systems biology approaches to reconstruct causal gene networks from large-scale omics data have therefore become essential to understand the structure of networks controlled by {eQTLs} together with other regulatory genes, and to generate detailed hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms that lead from genotype to phenotype. Here we review the main analytical methods and softwares to identify {eQTLs} and their associated genes, to reconstruct co-expression networks and modules, to reconstruct causal Bayesian gene and module networks, and to validate predicted networks in silico.},

Furthermore, numerous biases can arise from {RNA}-Seq technology, and these biases have to be identified and removed properly in order to obtain accurate results.Nowadays, many tools have been developed which allow to perform each step without high-level programming skills. However, each step of the pipeline needs to be performed carefully and requires a good knowledge of both the technology and the algorithms.In this comprehensive review, we describe the fundamental steps of the pipeline for {RNA}-Seq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes: raw data quality control, trimming and filtering procedures, alignment, postmapping quality control, counting, normalization and differential expression test.For each step, we present the most common tools and we give a complete description of their main characteristics and advantages focusing on the statistics that they perform and the assumptions that they make about the data.The choice of the right tool can have a big impact on the final results. Until now, no gold standard has been established for this type of analysis.In conclusion, this review can be useful for both educational purposes as well as for less experienced practitioners of animal genomic research.

However, the mechanism by which biological sex regulates behavioral states, which underlie the regulation of sex-shared behaviors, such as locomotion, is largely unknown. In this study, we studied sex differences in the behavioral states of Caenorhabditis elegans and found that males spend less time in a low locomotor activity state than hermaphrodites and that dopamine generates this sex difference. In males, dopamine reduces the low activity state by acting in the same pathway as polycystic kidney disease-related genes that function in male-specific neurons. In hermaphrodites, dopamine increases the low activity state by suppression of octopamine signaling in the sex-shared {SIA} neurons, which have reduced responsiveness to octopamine in males. Furthermore, dopamine promotes exploration both inside and outside of bacterial lawn (the food source) in males and suppresses it in hermaphrodites. These results demonstrate that sexually dimorphic signaling allows the same neuromodulator to promote adaptive behavior for each sex.{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} The mechanisms that generate sex differences in sex-shared behaviors, including locomotion, are not well understood. We show that there are sex differences in the regulation of behavioral states in the model animal Caenorhabditis elegans Dopamine promotes the high locomotor activity state in males, which must search for mates to reproduce, and suppresses it in self-fertilizing hermaphrodites through distinct molecular mechanisms. This study demonstrates that sex-specific signaling generates sex differences in the regulation of behavioral states, which in turn modulates the locomotor activity to suit reproduction for each sex.

	abstract = {Gene expression profiling with microarray technology suggests that peripheral blood cells might be a surrogate for postmortem brain tissue in studies of schizophrenia. The development of an accessible peripheral biomarker would substantially help in the diagnosis of this disease. We used a bioinformatics approach to examine whether the gene expression signature in whole blood contains enough information to make a specific diagnosis of schizophrenia. Unpaired t-tests of gene expression datasets from 52 antipsychotics-free schizophrenia patients and 49 normal controls identified 792 differentially expressed probes. Functional profiling with {DAVID} revealed that eleven of these genes were previously reported to be associated with schizophrenia, and 73 of them were expressed in the brain tissue. We analyzed the datasets with one of the supervised classifiers, artificial neural networks ({ANNs}). The samples were subdivided into training and testing sets. Quality filtering and stepwise forward selection identified 14 probes as predictors of the diagnosis. {ANNs} were then trained with the selected probes as the input and the training set for known diagnosis as the output. The constructed model achieved 91.2\% diagnostic accuracy in the training set and 87.9\% accuracy in the hold-out testing set. On the other hand, hierarchical clustering, a standard but unsupervised classifier, failed to separate patients and controls. These results suggest analysis of a blood-based gene expression signature with the supervised classifier, {ANNs}, might be a diagnostic tool for schizophrenia. Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Single-cell gene expression technologies are powerful tools to study cell types in the human brain, but efforts have largely focused on cortical brain regions. We therefore created a single-nucleus {RNA}-sequencing resource of 70,615 high-quality nuclei to generate a molecular taxonomy of cell types across five human brain regions that serve as key nodes of the human brain reward circuitry: nucleus accumbens, amygdala, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We first identified novel subpopulations of interneurons and medium spiny neurons ({MSNs}) in the nucleus accumbens and further characterized robust {GABAergic} inhibitory cell populations in the amygdala. Joint analyses across the 107 reported cell classes revealed cell-type substructure and unique patterns of transcriptomic dynamics. We identified discrete subpopulations of D1- and D2-expressing {MSNs} in the nucleus accumbens to which we mapped cell-type-specific enrichment for genetic risk associated with both psychiatric disease and addiction.

	abstract = {This paper advocates against permute-and-predict ({PaP}) methods for interpreting black box functions. Methods such as the variable importance measures proposed for random forests, partial dependence plots, and individual conditional expectation plots remain popular because of their ability to provide model-agnostic measures that depend only on the pre-trained model output. However, numerous studies have found that these tools can produce diagnostics that are highly misleading, particularly when there is strong dependence among features. Rather than simply add to this growing literature by further demonstrating such issues, here we seek to provide an explanation for the observed behavior. In particular, we argue that breaking dependencies between features in hold-out data places undue emphasis on sparse regions of the feature space by forcing the original model to extrapolate to regions where there is little to no data. We explore these effects through various settings where a ground-truth is understood and find support for previous claims in the literature that {PaP} metrics tend to over-emphasize correlated features both in variable importance and partial dependence plots, even though applying permutation methods to the ground-truth models do not. As an alternative, we recommend more direct approaches that have proven successful in other settings: explicitly removing features, conditional permutations, or model distillation methods.},

It has also become standard to ask whether different traits share the same causal variants, but one of the popular methods to answer this question, coloc, makes the simplifying assumption that only a single causal variant exists for any given trait in any genomic region. Here, we examine the potential of the recently proposed Sum of Single Effects ({SuSiE}) regression framework, which can be used for fine-mapping genetic signals, for use with coloc. {SuSiE} is a novel approach that allows evidence for association at multiple causal variants to be evaluated simultaneously, whilst separating the statistical support for each variant conditional on the causal signal being considered. We show this results in more accurate coloc inference than other proposals to adapt coloc for multiple causal variants based on conditioning. We therefore recommend that coloc be used in combination with {SuSiE} to optimise accuracy of colocalisation analyses when multiple causal variants exist.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07704},
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new deep learning approach, called neural association model ({NAM}), for probabilistic reasoning in artificial intelligence. We propose to use neural networks to model association between any two events in a domain. Neural networks take one event as input and compute a conditional probability of the other event to model how likely these two events are to be associated. The actual meaning of the conditional probabilities varies between applications and depends on how the models are trained. In this work, as two case studies, we have investigated two {NAM} structures, namely deep neural networks ({DNN}) and relation-modulated neural nets ({RMNN}), on several probabilistic reasoning tasks in {AI}, including recognizing textual entailment, triple classification in multi-relational knowledge bases and commonsense reasoning. Experimental results on several popular datasets derived from {WordNet}, {FreeBase} and {ConceptNet} have all demonstrated that both {DNNs} and {RMNNs} perform equally well and they can significantly outperform the conventional methods available for these reasoning tasks. Moreover, compared with {DNNs}, {RMNNs} are superior in knowledge transfer, where a pre-trained model can be quickly extended to an unseen relation after observing only a few training samples. To further prove the effectiveness of the proposed models, in this work, we have applied {NAMs} to solving challenging Winograd Schema ({WS}) problems. Experiments conducted on a set of {WS} problems prove that the proposed models have the potential for commonsense reasoning.},

	abstract = {Deciphering the biological mechanisms underlying a list of genes whose expression is under partial genetic control (i.e., having at least one {eQTL}) may not be as easy as for a list of differential genes. Indeed, no specific phenotype (e.g., health or production phenotype) is linked to the list of transcripts under study. There is a need to find a coherent biological interpretation of a list of genes under (partial) genetic control. We propose a pipeline using appropriate statistical tools to build a co-expression network from the list of genes, then to finely depict the network structure. Graphical models are relevant because they are based on partial correlations, closely linked with causal dependencies. Highly connected genes (hubs) and genes that are important for the global structure of the network (genes with high betweenness) are often biologically meaningful. Extracting modules of genes that are highly connected permits a significant enrichment in one biological function for each module, thus linking statistical results with biological significance. This approach has been previously used on a pig {eQTL} dataset (Villa-Vialaneix et al. 2013) and was proven to be highly relevant. Throughout the present chapter, we define statistical notions linked with network theory, and apply them on a reduced dataset of genes with {eQTL} that were found in the pig species to illustrate the basics of network inference and mining.},

Many methods have been proposed for accomplishing these and related aims, however the statistical properties of such methods generally are not well established. To this end, it is desirable to develop realistic mathematical and statistical models that can be used in a simulation context so that the impacts of data analysis methods and testing approaches can be established. A method is developed in which variation among arrays can be characterized simultaneously for a large number of genes resulting in a multivariate model of gene expression. The method is based on selecting mathematical transformations of the underlying expression measures such that the transformed variables follow approximately a Gaussian distribution, and then estimating associated parameters, including correlations. The result is a multivariate normal distribution that serves to model transformed gene expression values within a subject population, while accounting for covariances among genes and/or probes. This model then is used to simulate microarray expression and probe intensity data by employing a modified Cholesky matrix factorization technique which addresses the singularity problem for the “small nn, big pp” situation. An example is given using prostate cancer data and, as an illustration, it is shown how data normalization can be investigated using this approach.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Imputation of partially missing or unobserved genotypes is an indispensable tool for {SNP} data analyses. However, research and understanding of the impact of initial {SNP}-data quality control on imputation results is still limited. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the effect of different strategies of pre-imputation quality filtering on the performance of the widely used imputation algorithms {MaCH} and {IMPUTE}. {RESULTS}: We considered three scenarios: imputation of partially missing genotypes with usage of an external reference panel, without usage of an external reference panel, as well as imputation of completely un-typed {SNPs} using an external reference panel. We first created various datasets applying different {SNP} quality filters and masking certain percentages of randomly selected high-quality {SNPs}. We imputed these {SNPs} and compared the results between the different filtering scenarios by using established and newly proposed measures of imputation quality. While the established measures assess certainty of imputation results, our newly proposed measures focus on the agreement with true genotypes. These measures showed that pre-imputation {SNP}-filtering might be detrimental regarding imputation quality. Moreover, the strongest drivers of imputation quality were in general the burden of missingness and the number of {SNPs} used for imputation. We also found that using a reference panel always improves imputation quality of partially missing genotypes. {MaCH} performed slightly better than {IMPUTE}2 in most of our scenarios. Again, these results were more pronounced when using our newly defined measures of imputation quality. {CONCLUSION}: Even a moderate filtering has a detrimental effect on the imputation quality. Therefore little or no {SNP} filtering prior to imputation appears to be the best strategy for imputing small to moderately sized datasets. Our results also showed that for these datasets, {MaCH} performs slightly better than {IMPUTE}2 in most scenarios at the cost of increased computing time.},

We sought to identify genetic risk variants within four previously-identified ancestry-associated regions-6p24.3-p12.1, 17p13.3-13.1, 2p13.3-q12.1, and 6q23.3-q25.2-in a sample of 2,727 African Americans. We used logistic regression fit by generalized estimating equations and the {MIX} score statistic to determine which variants within ancestry-associated regions were associated with risk and responsible for the admixture signal. Fine mapping was performed by imputation, based on a previous genome-wide association study; significant variants were validated by direct genotyping. Within the 6p24.3-p12.1 locus, the most significant ancestry-adjusted {SNP} was rs74318745 (p = 9.4*10-11), an intronic {SNP} within the {HLA}-{DRA} gene that did not solely explain the admixture signal, indicating the presence of more than a single risk variant within this well-established sarcoidosis risk region. The locus on chromosome 17p13.3-13.1 revealed a novel sarcoidosis risk {SNP}, rs6502976 (p = 9.5*10-6), within intron 5 of the gene X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Associated Factor 1 ({XAF}1) that accounted for the majority of the admixture linkage signal. Immunohistochemical expression studies demonstrated lack of expression of {XAF}1 and a corresponding high level of expression of its downstream target, X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis ({XIAP}) in sarcoidosis granulomas. In conclusion, ancestry and association fine mapping revealed a novel sarcoidosis susceptibility gene, {XAF}1, which has not been identified by previous genome-wide association studies. Based on the known biology of the {XIAP}/{XAF}1 apoptosis pathway and the differential expression patterns of {XAF}1 and {XIAP} in sarcoidosis granulomas, we suggest that this pathway may play a role in the maintenance of sarcoidosis granulomas.},

	abstract = {The use of kernel density estimates in discriminant analysis is quite well known among scientists and engineers interested in statistical pattern recognition. Using a kernel density estimate involves properly selecting the scale of smoothing, namely the bandwidth parameter. The bandwidth that is optimum for the mean integrated square error of a class density estimator may not always be good for discriminant analysis, where the main emphasis is on the minimization of misclassification rates. On the other hand, cross-validation–based methods for bandwidth selection, which try to minimize estimated misclassification rates, may require huge computation when there are several competing populations. Besides, such methods usually allow only one bandwidth for each population density estimate, whereas in a classification problem, the optimum bandwidth for a class density estimate may vary significantly, depending on its competing class densities and their prior probabilities. Therefore, in a multiclass problem, it would be more meaningful to have different bandwidths for a class density when it is compared with different competing class densities. Moreover, good choice of bandwidths should also depend on the specific observation to be classified. Consequently, instead of concentrating on a single optimum bandwidth for each population density estimate, it is more useful in practice to look at the results for different scales of smoothing for the kernel density estimates. This article presents such a multiscale approach along with a graphical device leading to a more informative discriminant analysis than the usual approach based on a single optimum scale of smoothing for each class density estimate. When there are more than two competing classes, this method splits the problem into a number of two-class problems, which allows the flexibility of using different bandwidths for different pairs of competing classes and at the same time reduces the computational burden that one faces for usual cross-validation–based bandwidth selection in the presence of several competing populations. We present some benchmark examples to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology.},

One important task is to identify biological conditions that lead to unusually high or low expression of a particular gene. Packages such as {DESeq} implement a simple method for testing differential signal when exactly two biological conditions are possible. For more than two conditions, pairwise testing is typically used. Here the {DESeq} method is extended so that three or more biological conditions can be assessed simultaneously. Because the computation time grows exponentially in the number of conditions, a Monte Carlo approach provides a fast way to approximate the pp-values for the new test. The approach is studied on both simulated data and a data set of \{{\textbackslash}textbackslashem C. jejuni\}, the bacteria responsible for most food poisoning in the United States.},

	abstract = {Genome-Wide Association Studies ({GWAS}) are used to identify statistically significant genetic variants in case-control studies. The main objective is to find single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) that influence a particular phenotype (i.e., disease trait). {GWAS} typically use a p-value threshold of 5*10-8 to identify highly ranked {SNPs}. While this approach has proven useful for detecting disease-susceptible {SNPs}, evidence has shown that many of these are, in fact, false positives. Consequently, there is some ambiguity about the most suitable threshold for claiming genome-wide significance. Many believe that using lower p-values will allow us to investigate the joint epistatic interactions between {SNPs} and provide better insights into phenotype expression. One example that uses this approach is multifactor dimensionality reduction ({MDR}), which identifies combinations of {SNPs} that interact to influence a particular outcome. However, computational complexity is increased exponentially as a function of higher-order combinations making approaches like {MDR} difficult to implement. Even so, understanding epistatic interactions in complex diseases is a fundamental component for robust genotype-phenotype mapping. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines {GWAS} quality control and logistic regression with deep learning stacked autoencoders to abstract higher-order {SNP} interactions from large, complex genotyped data for case-control classification tasks in {GWAS} analysis. We focus on the challenging problem of classifying preterm births which has a strong genetic component with unexplained heritability reportedly between 20-40 percent. A {GWAS} data set, obtained from {dbGap} is utilised, which contains predominantly urban low-income African-American women who had normal and preterm deliveries. Epistatic interactions from original {SNP} sequences were extracted through a deep learning stacked autoencoder model and used to fine-tune a classifier for discriminating between term and preterm births observations. All models are evaluated using standard binary classifier performance metrics. The findings show that important information pertaining to {SNPs} and epistasis can be extracted from 4,666 raw {SNPs} generated using logistic regression (p-value = 5*10-3) and used to fit a highly accurate classifier model. The following results (Sen = 0.9562, Spec = 0.8780, Gini = 0.9490, Logloss = 0.5901, {AUC} = 0.9745, and {MSE} = 0.2010) were obtained using 50 hidden nodes and (Sen = 0.9289, Spec = 0.9591, Gini = 0.9651, Logloss = 0.3080, {AUC} = 0.9825, and {MSE} = 0.0942) using 500 hidden nodes. The results were compared with a Support Vector Machine ({SVM}), a Random Forest ({RF}), and a Fishers Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier, which all failed to improve on the deep learning approach.},

	abstract = {A major challenge in biomedical studies in recent years has been the classification of gene expression profiles into categories, such as cases and controls. This is done by first training a classifier by using a labeled training set containing labeled samples from the two populations, and then using that classifier to predict the labels of new samples. Such predictions have recently been shown to improve the diagnosis and treatment selection practices for several diseases. This procedure is complicated, however, by the high dimensionality if the data. While microarrays can measure the levels of thousands of genes per sample, case-control microarray studies usually involve no more than several dozen samples. Standard classifiers do not work well in these situations where the number of features (gene expression levels measured in these microarrays) far exceeds the number of samples. Selecting only the features that are most relevant for discriminating between the two categories can help construct better classifiers, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In this work we developed a novel method for multivariate feature selection based on the Partial Least Squares algorithm. We compared the method's variants with common feature selection techniques across a large number of real case-control datasets, using several classifiers. We demonstrate the advantages of the method and the preferable combinations of classifier and feature selection technique.},

We analysed 1126 genes relating to 25 subtypes of Mendelian neurological disease defined by Genomics England (March 2017) together with 154 gene-specific features capturing genetic variation, gene structure and tissue-specific expression and co-expression. We randomly re-sampled genes with no known disease association to develop bootstrapped decision-tree models, which were integrated to generate a decision tree-based ensemble for each disease subtype. Genes generating larger numbers of distinct transcripts and with higher probability of having missense mutations in normal individuals were significantly more likely to cause neurological diseases. Using mouse-mutant phenotypic data we tested the accuracy of gene-phenotype predictions and found that for 88\% of all disease subtypes there was a significant enrichment of relevant phenotypic abnormalities when predicted genes were mutated in mice and in many cases mutations produced specific and matching phenotypes. Furthermore, using only newly identified genes included in the Genomics England November 2017 release, we assessed our gene-phenotype predictions and showed an 8.3 fold enrichment relative to chance for correct predictions. Thus, we demonstrate both the explanatory and predictive power of machine-learning-based models in neurological disease.},

Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from {DNA} sequences through the use of a deep learning architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer-promoter interactions directly from the {DNA} sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

Our results advance the collective knowledge and understanding of brain cell-type organization1-5. First, our study reveals a unified molecular genetic landscape of cortical cell types that integrates their transcriptome, open chromatin and {DNA} methylation maps. Second, cross-species analysis achieves a consensus taxonomy of transcriptomic types and their hierarchical organization that is conserved from mouse to marmoset and human. Third, in situ single-cell transcriptomics provides a spatially resolved cell-type atlas of the motor cortex. Fourth, cross-modal analysis provides compelling evidence for the transcriptomic, epigenomic and gene regulatory basis of neuronal phenotypes such as their physiological and anatomical properties, demonstrating the biological validity and genomic underpinning of neuron types. We further present an extensive genetic toolset for targeting glutamatergic neuron types towards linking their molecular and developmental identity to their circuit function. Together, our results establish a unifying and mechanistic framework of neuronal cell-type organization that integrates multi-layered molecular genetic and spatial information with multi-faceted phenotypic properties. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

Some increase in prevalence may stem from changing environmental conditions in the current generation which interact with genes and inherited genetic variants. Current measured genetic variant effects do not explain fully the familial clustering and high heritability estimates in the population. Another model considers environmental conditions shifting in the previous generation, which altered brain circuits epigenetically and were transmitted to offspring via non-{DNA}-based mechanisms (intergenerational and transgenerational effects). Parental substance use, poor diet and obesity are environmental factors with known epigenetic intergenerational and transgenerational effects, that regulate set points in brain pathways integrating sensory-motor, reward and feeding behaviors. Using summary statistics for eleven neuropsychiatric and three metabolic disorders from 128,989 families, an epigenetic effect explains more of the estimated heritability when a portion of parental environmental effects are transmitted to offspring alongside additive genetic variance.},

	abstract = {Neurological and psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders, share a range of symptoms, which could be the result of shared genetic background. Many genetic loci have been identified for these disorders using genome-wide association studies, but conclusive evidence about cell types wherein these loci are active is lacking. We aimed to uncover implicated brain cell types in neuropsychiatric traits and to assess consistency in results across {RNA} datasets and methods. We therefore comprehensively employed cell type enrichment methods by integrating single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse brain regions with an unprecedented dataset of 42 human genome-wide association study results of neuropsychiatric, substance use and behavioral/quantitative brain-related traits (n = 12,544,007 individuals). Single-cell transcriptomic datasets from the Karolinska Institute and 10x Genomics were used. Cell type enrichment was determined using Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression, Multi-marker Analysis of {GenoMic} Annotation, and Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits. We found the largest degree of consistency across methods for implication of pyramidal cells in schizophrenia and cognitive performance. For other phenotypes, such as bipolar disorder, two methods implicated the same cell types, i.e., medium spiny neurons and pyramidal cells. For autism spectrum disorders and anorexia nervosa, no consistency in implicated cell types was observed across methods. We found no evidence for astrocytes being consistently implicated in neuropsychiatric traits. In conclusion, we provide comprehensive evidence for a subset of neuronal cell types being consistently implicated in several, but not all psychiatric disorders, while non-neuronal cell types seem less implicated. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

	abstract = {The extreme diversity of the human immune system, forged and maintained throughout evolutionary history, provides a potent defense against opportunistic pathogens. At the same time, this immune variation is the substrate upon which a plethora of immune-associated diseases develop. Genetic analysis suggests that thousands of individually weak loci together drive up to half of the observed immune variation. Intense selection maintains this genetic diversity, even selecting for the introgressed Neanderthal or Denisovan alleles that have reintroduced variation lost during the out-of-Africa migration. Variations in age, sex, diet, environmental exposure, and microbiome each potentially explain the residual variation, with proof-of-concept studies demonstrating both plausible mechanisms and correlative associations. The confounding interaction of many of these variables currently makes it difficult to assign definitive contributions. Here, we review the current state of play in the field, identify the key unknowns in the causality of immune variation, and identify the multidisciplinary pathways toward an improved understanding. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

We validated unambiguous isoform assignment with {MAS}-{ISO}-seq using a synthetic {RNA} isoform library and applied this approach to single-cell {RNA} sequencing of tumor-infiltrating T cells. Results demonstrated a {\textbackslash}textgreater30 fold boosted discovery of differentially spliced genes and robust cell clustering, as well as canonical {PTPRC} splicing patterns across T cell subpopulations and the concerted expression of the associated {hnRNPLL} splicing factor.

We used single-cell {RNA} sequencing to quantify variation in the response to influenza infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from European- and African-ancestry males. Genetic ancestry effects are common but highly cell type specific. Higher levels of European ancestry are associated with increased type I interferon pathway activity in early infection, which predicts reduced viral titers at later time points. Substantial population-associated variation is explained by cis-expression quantitative trait loci that are differentiated by genetic ancestry. Furthermore, genetic ancestry–associated genes are enriched among genes correlated with {COVID}-19 disease severity, suggesting that the early immune response contributes to ancestry-associated differences for multiple viral infection outcomes.},

	abstract = {Due to an inability to ethically access developing human brain tissue as well as identify prospective cases, early-arising neurodevelopmental and cell-specific signatures of Schizophrenia (Scz) have remained unknown and thus undefined. To overcome these challenges, we utilized patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs}) to generate 3D cerebral organoids to model neuropathology of Scz during this critical period. We discovered that Scz organoids exhibited ventricular neuropathology resulting in altered progenitor survival and disrupted neurogenesis. This ultimately yielded fewer neurons within developing cortical fields of Scz organoids. Single-cell sequencing revealed that Scz progenitors were specifically depleted of neuronal programming factors leading to a remodeling of cell-lineages, altered differentiation trajectories, and distorted cortical cell-type diversity. While Scz organoids were similar in their macromolecular diversity to organoids generated from healthy controls (Ctrls), four {GWAS} factors ({PTN}, {COMT}, {PLCL}1, and {PODXL}) and peptide fragments belonging to the {POU}-domain transcription factor family (e.g., {POU}3F2/{BRN}2) were altered. This revealed that Scz organoids principally differed not in their proteomic diversity, but specifically in their total quantity of disease and neurodevelopmental factors at the molecular level. Single-cell sequencing subsequently identified cell-type specific alterations in neuronal programming factors as well as a developmental switch in neurotrophic growth factor expression, indicating that Scz neuropathology can be encoded on a cell-type-by-cell-type basis. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing also specifically replicated the depletion of {BRN}2 ({POU}3F2) and {PTN} in both Scz progenitors and neurons. Subsequently, in two mechanistic rescue experiments we identified that the transcription factor {BRN}2 and growth factor {PTN} operate as mechanistic substrates of neurogenesis and cellular survival, respectively, in Scz organoids. Collectively, our work suggests that multiple mechanisms of Scz exist in patient-derived organoids, and that these disparate mechanisms converge upon primordial brain developmental pathways such as neuronal differentiation, survival, and growth factor support, which may amalgamate to elevate intrinsic risk of Scz. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {DNA} methylation dynamics in the brain are associated with normal development and neuropsychiatric disease and differ across functionally distinct brain regions. Previous studies of genome-wide methylation differences among human brain regions focus on limited numbers of individuals and one to two brain regions. {RESULTS}: Using {GTEx} samples, we generate a resource of {DNA} methylation in purified neuronal nuclei from 8 brain regions as well as lung and thyroid tissues from 12 to 23 donors. We identify differentially methylated regions between brain regions among neuronal nuclei in both {CpG} (181,146) and non-{CpG} (264,868) contexts, few of which were unique to a single pairwise comparison. This significantly expands the knowledge of differential methylation across the brain by 10-fold. In addition, we present the first differential methylation analysis among neuronal nuclei from basal ganglia tissues and identify unique {CpG} differentially methylated regions, many associated with ion transport. We also identify 81,130 regions of variably {CpG} methylated regions, i.e., variable methylation among individuals in the same brain region, which are enriched in regulatory regions and in {CpG} differentially methylated regions. Many variably methylated regions are unique to a specific brain region, with only 202 common across all brain regions, as well as lung and thyroid. Variably methylated regions identified in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus are enriched for heritability of schizophrenia. {CONCLUSIONS}: These data suggest that epigenetic variation in these particular human brain regions could be associated with the risk for this neuropsychiatric disorder.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, but the exact disease aetiology remains largely unknown. To date, Parkinson's disease research has mainly focused on nigral dopaminergic neurons, although recent studies suggest disease-related changes also in non-neuronal cells and in midbrain regions beyond the substantia nigra. While there is some evidence for glial involvement in Parkinson's disease, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the contribution of all cell types of the midbrain to Parkinson's disease pathology by single-nuclei {RNA} sequencing and to assess the cell type-specific risk for Parkinson's disease using the latest genome-wide association study. We profiled {\textbackslash}textgreater41 000 single-nuclei transcriptomes of post-mortem midbrain from six idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients and five age-/sex-matched controls. To validate our findings in a spatial context, we utilized immunolabelling of the same tissues. Moreover, we analysed Parkinson's disease-associated risk enrichment in genes with cell type-specific expression patterns. We discovered a neuronal cell cluster characterized by {CADPS}2 overexpression and low {TH} levels, which was exclusively present in idiopathic Parkinson's disease midbrains. Validation analyses in laser-microdissected neurons suggest that this cluster represents dysfunctional dopaminergic neurons. With regard to glial cells, we observed an increase in nigral microglia in Parkinson's disease patients. Moreover, nigral idiopathic Parkinson's disease microglia were more amoeboid, indicating an activated state. We also discovered a reduction in idiopathic Parkinson's disease oligodendrocyte numbers with the remaining cells being characterized by a stress-induced upregulation of S100B. Parkinson's disease risk variants were associated with glia- and neuron-specific gene expression patterns in idiopathic Parkinson's disease cases. Furthermore, astrocytes and microglia presented idiopathic Parkinson's disease-specific cell proliferation and dysregulation of genes related to unfolded protein response and cytokine signalling. While reactive patient astrocytes showed {CD}44 overexpression, idiopathic Parkinson's disease microglia revealed a pro-inflammatory trajectory characterized by elevated levels of {IL}1B, {GPNMB} and {HSP}90AA1. Taken together, we generated the first single-nuclei {RNA} sequencing dataset from the idiopathic Parkinson's disease midbrain, which highlights a disease-specific neuronal cell cluster as well as 'pan-glial' activation as a central mechanism in the pathology of the movement disorder. This finding warrants further research into inflammatory signalling and immunomodulatory treatments in Parkinson's disease. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2022.

We performed systematic analyses to investigate various aspects of microglial heterogeneities, including brain region and aging. We mapped expression and splicing quantitative trait loci and showed that many neurological disease susceptibility loci are mediated through gene expression or splicing in microglia. Fine-mapping of these loci nominated candidate causal variants that are within microglia-specific enhancers, finding associations with microglial expression of {USP}6NL for Alzheimer's disease and P2RY12 for Parkinson's disease. We have built the most comprehensive catalog to date of genetic effects on the microglial transcriptome and propose candidate functional variants in neurological and psychiatric disorders. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

	abstract = {Many studies have reported that patients with psychosis, even before drug treatment, have mildly raised levels of blood cytokines relative to healthy controls. In contrast, there is a remarkable scarcity of studies investigating the cellular basis of immune function and cytokine changes in psychosis. The few flow-cytometry studies have been limited to counting the proportion of the major classes of monocyte and lymphocytes without distinguishing their pro- and anti-inflammatory subsets. Moreover, most of the investigations are cross-sectional and conducted with patients on long-term medication. These features make it difficult to eliminate confounding of illness-related changes by lifestyle factors, disease duration, and long exposure to antipsychotics. This article focuses on regulatory T cells (Tregs), cornerstone immune cells that regulate innate and adaptive immune forces and neuro-immune interactions between astrocytes and microglia. Tregs are also implicated in cardio-metabolic disorders that are common comorbidities of psychosis. We have recently proposed that Tregs are hypofunctional ('h-Tregs') in psychosis driven by our clinical findings and other independent research. Our h-Treg-glial imbalance hypothesis offers a new account for the co-occurrence of systemic immune dysregulation and mechanisms of psychosis development. This article extends our recent review, the h-Treg hypothesis, to cover new discoveries on Treg-based therapies from pre-clinical findings and their clinical implications. We provide a detailed characterisation of Treg studies in psychosis, identifying important methodological limitations and perspectives for scientific innovation. The outcomes presented in this article reaffirms our proposed h-Treg state in psychosis and reveals emerging preclinical research suggesting the potential benefit of Treg-enhancing therapies. There is a clear need for longitudinal studies conducted with drug-naïve or minimally treated patients using more sophisticated techniques of flow-cytometry, {CyTOF} expression markers, and in vitro co-culture assays to formally test the suppressive capacity of Tregs. Investment in Treg research offers major potential benefits in targeting emerging immunomodulatory treatment modalities on person-specific immune dysregulations.},

	abstract = {While large-scale, genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) have identified hundreds of loci associated with brain-related traits, identification of the variants, genes and molecular mechanisms underlying these traits remains challenging. Integration of {GWAS} with expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}) and identification of shared genetic architecture have been widely adopted to nominate genes and candidate causal variants. However, this approach is limited by sample size, statistical power and linkage disequilibrium. We developed the multivariate multiple {QTL} approach and performed a large-scale, multi-ancestry {eQTL} meta-analysis to increase power and fine-mapping resolution. Analysis of 3,983 {RNA}-sequenced samples from 2,119 donors, including 474 non-European individuals, yielded an effective sample size of 3,154. Joint statistical fine-mapping of {eQTL} and {GWAS} identified 329 variant-trait pairs for 24 brain-related traits driven by 204 unique candidate causal variants for 189 unique genes. This integrative analysis identifies candidate causal variants and elucidates potential regulatory mechanisms for genes underlying schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

	abstract = {Lack of diversity in human genomics limits our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, hinders precision medicine, and contributes to health disparities. To map genetic effects on gene regulation in the underrepresented Indonesian population, we have integrated genotype, gene expression, and {CpG} methylation data from 115 participants across three island populations that capture the major sources of genomic diversity in the region. In a comparison with European datasets, we identify {eQTLs} shared between Indonesia and Europe as well as population-specific {eQTLs} that exhibit differences in allele frequencies and/or overall expression levels between populations. By combining local ancestry and archaic introgression inference with {eQTLs} and {methylQTLs}, we identify regulatory loci driven by modern Papuan ancestry as well as introgressed Denisovan and Neanderthal variation. {GWAS} colocalization connects {QTLs} detected here to hematological traits, and further comparison with European datasets reflects the poor overall transferability of {GWAS} statistics across diverse populations. Our findings illustrate how population-specific genetic architecture, local ancestry, and archaic introgression drive variation in gene regulation across genetically distinct and in admixed populations and highlight the need for performing association studies on non-European populations.

Using this technology, we discovered 14 genes in the rat striatum whose expression was changed by {\textbackslash}textgreater/= 50\% following chronic haloperidol treatment. Among them was the synapsin {II} gene, which was found to be significantly up-regulated after the treatment. Since recent studies have implicated this gene in schizophrenia, further experiments were performed to determine whether chronic haloperidol exposure resulted in concurrent increases in the expression of striatal synapsin {II} protein. Immunoblotting revealed that protein levels of both the a and b isoforms of synapsin {II} were also increased by comparable amounts following haloperidol treatment. This study is the first to show the regulation of synapsin {II} expression by haloperidol at the transcript and protein level in rat striatum. A possible mechanism for the observed haloperidol-induced increase in striatal synapsin {II} expression, along with the implications of this up-regulation in chronic haloperidol treatment, is presented.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A key task in single-cell {RNA}-seq ({scRNA}-seq) data analysis is to accurately detect the number of cell types in the sample, which can be critical for downstream analyses such as cell type identification. Various {scRNA}-seq data clustering algorithms have been specifically designed to automatically estimate the number of cell types through optimising the number of clusters in a dataset. The lack of benchmark studies, however, complicates the choice of the methods. {RESULTS}: We systematically benchmark a range of popular clustering algorithms on estimating the number of cell types in a variety of settings by sampling from the Tabula Muris data to create {scRNA}-seq datasets with a varying number of cell types, varying number of cells in each cell type, and different cell type proportions. The large number of datasets enables us to assess the performance of the algorithms, covering four broad categories of approaches, from various aspects using a panel of criteria. We further cross-compared the performance on datasets with high cell numbers using Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens data. {CONCLUSIONS}: We identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method on multiple criteria including the deviation of estimation from the true number of cell types, variability of estimation, clustering concordance of cells to their predefined cell types, and running time and peak memory usage. We then summarise these results into a multi-aspect recommendation to the users. The proposed stability-based approach for estimating the number of cell types is implemented in an R package and is freely available from ( https://github.com/{PYangLab}/{scCCE}{\textbackslash}{SS} ). {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

	abstract = {The human brain vasculature is of great medical importance: its dysfunction causes disability and death1, and the specialized structure it forms-the blood-brain barrier-impedes the treatment of nearly all brain disorders2,3. Yet so far, we have no molecular map of the human brain vasculature. Here we develop vessel isolation and nuclei extraction for sequencing ({VINE}-seq) to profile the major vascular and perivascular cell types of the human brain through 143,793 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 25 hippocampus and cortex samples of 9 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 8 individuals with no cognitive impairment. We identify brain-region- and species-enriched genes and pathways. We reveal molecular principles of human arteriovenous organization, recapitulating a gradual endothelial and punctuated mural cell continuum. We discover two subtypes of human pericytes, marked by solute transport and extracellular matrix ({ECM}) organization; and define perivascular versus meningeal fibroblast specialization. In Alzheimer's disease, we observe selective vulnerability of {ECM}-maintaining pericytes and gene expression patterns that implicate dysregulated blood flow. With an expanded survey of brain cell types, we find that 30 of the top 45 genes that have been linked to Alzheimer's disease risk by genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) are expressed in the human brain vasculature, and we confirm this by immunostaining. Vascular {GWAS} genes map to endothelial protein transport, adaptive immune and {ECM} pathways. Many are microglia-specific in mice, suggesting a partial evolutionary transfer of Alzheimer's disease risk. Our work uncovers the molecular basis of the human brain vasculature, which will inform our understanding of overall brain health, disease and therapy. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

The molecular architecture of the disease remains to be fully elucidated. We performed single-nucleus transcriptomics and unbiased proteomics using postmortem tissue obtained from the prefrontal cortex of 12 individuals with late-stage {PD} and age-matched controls. We analyzed ∼80,000 nuclei and identified eight major cell types, including brain-resident T cells, each with distinct transcriptional changes in line with the known genetics of {PD}. By analyzing Lewy body pathology in the same postmortem tissue, we found that a-synuclein pathology is inversely correlated with chaperone expression in excitatory neurons. Examining cell-cell interactions, we found a selective abatement of neuron-astrocyte interactions and enhanced neuroinflammation. Proteomic analyses of the same brains identified synaptic proteins in prefrontal cortex that were preferentially downregulated in {PD}. Strikingly, comparing this dataset to a regionally similar published analysis for Alzheimer's disease ({AD}), we found no common differentially expressed genes in neurons, but identified many shared differentially expressed genes in glial cells, suggesting that disease etiology in {PD} and {AD} are likely distinct. These data are presented as a resource for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of {PD} and other neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: T cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis ({MS}), a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system ({CNS}). Although several studies recently investigated the T-cell receptor ({TCR}) repertoire in cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF}) of {MS} patients by high-throughput sequencing ({HTS}), a deep analysis on repertoire similarities and differences among compartments is still missing. {METHODS}: We performed comprehensive bioinformatics on high-dimensional {TCR} V{\textbackslash}beta sequencing data from published and unpublished {MS} and healthy donors ({HD}) studies. We evaluated repertoire polarization, clone distribution, shared {CDR}3 amino acid sequences ({CDR}3s-a.a.) across repertoires, clone overlap with public databases, and {TCR} similarity architecture. {FINDINGS}: {CSF} repertoires showed a significantly higher public clones percentage and sequence similarity compared to peripheral blood ({PB}). On the other hand, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the repertoire polarization is the same between {CSF} and {PB}. One Primary-Progressive {MS} ({PPMS}) {CSF} repertoire differed from the others in terms of {TCR} similarity architecture. Cluster analysis splits {MS} from {HD}. {INTERPRETATION}: In {MS} patients, the presence of a physiological barrier, the blood-brain barrier, does not impact clone prevalence and distribution, but impacts public clones, indicating {CSF} as a more private site. We reported a high V{\textbackslash}beta sequence similarity in the {CSF}-{TCR} architecture in one {PPMS}. If confirmed it may be an interesting insight into {MS} progressive inflammatory mechanisms. The clustering of {MS} repertoires from {HD} suggests that disease shapes the {TCR} V{\textbackslash}beta clonal profile. {FUNDING}: This study was partly financially supported by the Italian Multiple Sclerosis Foundation ({FISM}), that contributed to Ballerini-{DB} data collection (grant \#2015 R02).

We examined differential gene expression between cases and controls and the transcriptional effects of {BD}-associated genetic variants. We found two coexpressed modules that were associated with transcriptional changes in {BD}: one enriched for immune and inflammatory genes and the other with genes related to the postsynaptic membrane. Over 50\% of {BD} genome-wide significant loci contained significant expression quantitative trait loci ({QTL}) ({eQTL}), and these data converged on several individual genes, including {SCN}2A and {GRIN}2A.

	abstract = {Antipsychotic drugs are the current first-line of treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions. However, their molecular effects on the human brain are poorly studied, due to difficulty of tissue access and confounders associated with disease status. Here we examine differences in gene expression and {DNA} methylation associated with positive antipsychotic drug toxicology status in the human caudate nucleus. We find no genome-wide significant differences in {DNA} methylation, but abundant differences in gene expression. These gene expression differences are overall quite similar to gene expression differences between schizophrenia cases and controls. Interestingly, gene expression differences based on antipsychotic toxicology are different between brain regions, potentially due to affected cell type differences. We finally assess similarities with effects in a mouse model, which finds some overlapping effects but many differences as well. As a first look at the molecular effects of antipsychotics in the human brain, the lack of epigenetic effects is unexpected, possibly because long term treatment effects may be relatively stable for extended periods. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

This approach allows the flexibility of remotely uploading code on motes to be combined with a set of guarantees for the programmer. The choice of the specific set of components in a virtual machine configuration defines the abstraction level seen by the application script. We describe a specific component library built for Terra, which we designed taking into account the functionality commonly needed in {WSN} applications—typically for sense and control. We also discuss the programming environment resulting from the combination of a statically analyzable scripting language with this library of components. Finally, we evaluate Terra by measuring its overhead in a basic application and discussing its use and cost in a typical monitoring {WSN} scenario.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Depression is a widespread phenomenon with varying degrees of pathology in different patients. Various hypotheses have been proposed for the cause and continuance of depression. Some of these include, but not limited to, the monoamine hypothesis, the neuroendocrine hypothesis, and the more recent epigenetic and inflammatory hypotheses. {OBJECTIVE}: In this article, we review all the above hypotheses with a focus on the role of mitochondria as the connecting link. Oxidative stress, respiratory activity, mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism are some of the mitochondria-dependent factors which are affected during depression. We also propose exogenous {ATP} as a contributing factor to depression. {RESULT}: Literature review shows that pro-inflammatory markers are elevated in depressive individuals. The cause for elevated levels of cytokines in depression is not completely understood. We propose exogenous {ATP} activates purinergic receptors which in turn increase the levels of various proinflammatory factors in the pathophysiology of depression. {CONCLUSION}: Mitochondria are integral to the function of neurons and undergo dysfunction in major depressive disorder patients. This dysfunction is reflected in all the various hypotheses that have been proposed for depression. Among the newer targets identified, which also involve mitochondria, includes the role of exogenous {ATP}. The diversity of purinergic receptors, and their differential expression among various individuals in the population, due to genetic and environmental (prenatal) influences, may influence the susceptibility and severity of depression. Identifying specific receptors involved and using patient-specific purinergic receptor antagonist may be an appropriate therapeutic course in the future.

	abstract = {Stroke disproportionately affects racial minorities, and the level to which stroke treatment practices differ across races is understudied. Here, we performed a systematic review of disparities in stroke treatment between racial minorities and White patients. A systematic literature search was performed on {PubMed} to identify studies published from January 1, 2010, to April 5, 2021 that investigated disparities in access to stroke treatment between racial minorities and White patients. A total of 30 studies were included in the systematic review. White patients were estimated to use emergency medical services at a greater rate (59.8\%) than African American (55.6\%), Asian (54.7\%), and Hispanic patients (53.2\%). A greater proportion of White patients (37.4\%) were estimated to arrive within 3 hours from onset of stroke symptoms than African American (26.0\%) and Hispanic (28.9\%) patients. A greater proportion of White patients (2.8\%) were estimated to receive {tPA} (tissue-type plasminogen activator) as compared with African American (2.3\%), Hispanic (2.6\%), and Asian (2.3\%) patients. Rates of utilization of mechanical thrombectomy were also lower in minorities than in the White population. As shown in this review, racial disparities exist at key points along the continuum of stroke care from onset of stroke symptoms to treatment. Beyond patient level factors, these disparities may be attributed to other provider and system level factors within the health care ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder) are a leading cause of morbidity and premature mortality and an overlooked health inequity in the United States. European data indicate inequities in incidence, severity, and treatment of psychotic disorders, particularly for Black communities, that appear to be primarily attributable to social adversities. The dominant {US} narrative is that any observed differences are primarily a result of clinician bias and misdiagnosis. We propose that employing the framework of structural racism will prompt European and {US} research to converge and consider the multifaceted drivers of inequities in psychotic disorders among Black Americans. In particular, we describe how historical and contemporary practices of (1) racialized policing and incarceration, and (2) economic exploitation and disinvestment, which are already linked to other psychiatric disorders, likely contribute to risks and experiences of psychotic disorders among Black Americans. This framework can inform new strategies to (1) document the role of racism in the incidence, severity, and treatment of psychotic disorders; and (2) dismantle how racism operates in the United States, including defunding the police, abolishing carceral systems, and redirecting funds to invest in neighborhoods, housing, and community-based crisis response and mental health care.

We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study totaling 111,326 clinically diagnosed/'proxy' {AD} cases and 677,663 controls. We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future {AD}/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to {AD}/dementia. The improvement in prediction led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in {AD} risk from the lowest to the highest decile, in addition to effects of age and the {APOE} {\textbackslash}varepsilon4 allele. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

	abstract = {Schizophrenia has a heritability of 60-80\%1, much of which is attributable to common risk alleles. Here, in a two-stage genome-wide association study of up to 76,755 individuals with schizophrenia and 243,649 control individuals, we report common variant associations at 287 distinct genomic loci. Associations were concentrated in genes that are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the central nervous system, but not in other tissues or cell types. Using fine-mapping and functional genomic data, we identify 120 genes (106 protein-coding) that are likely to underpin associations at some of these loci, including 16 genes with credible causal non-synonymous or untranslated region variation. We also implicate fundamental processes related to neuronal function, including synaptic organization, differentiation and transmission. Fine-mapped candidates were enriched for genes associated with rare disruptive coding variants in people with schizophrenia, including the glutamate receptor subunit {GRIN}2A and transcription factor {SP}4, and were also enriched for genes implicated by such variants in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identify biological processes relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology; show convergence of common and rare variant associations in schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders; and provide a resource of prioritized genes and variants to advance mechanistic studies. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: The global prevalence of autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) has been reported to be between 1\% and 2\% of the population, with little research in Black, Asian, and other racial/ethnic minority groups. Accurate estimates of {ASD} prevalence are vital to planning diagnostic, educational, health, and social care services and may detect possible access barriers to diagnostic pathways and services and inequalities based on social determinants of health. {OBJECTIVE}: To evaluate whether socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with {ASD} prevalence and the likelihood of accessing {ASD} services in racial/ethnic minority and disadvantaged groups in England. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: This case-control prevalence cohort study used the Spring School Census 2017 from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census of the National Pupil Database, which is a total population sample that includes all English children, adolescents, and young adults aged 2 to 21 years in state-funded education. Data were collected on January 17, 2017, and analyzed from August 2, 2018, to January 28, 2020. {EXPOSURES}: Age and sex were treated as a priori confounders while assessing correlates of {ASD} status according to (1) race/ethnicity, (2) social disadvantage, (3) first language spoken, (4) Education, Health and Care Plan or {ASD} Special Educational Needs and Disability support status, and (5) mediation analysis to assess how social disadvantage and language might affect {ASD} status. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: Sex- and age-standardized {ASD} prevalence by race/ethnicity and 326 English local authority districts in pupils aged 5 to 19 years. {RESULTS}: The final population sample consisted of 7 047 238 pupils (50.99\% male; mean [{SD}] age, 10.18 [3.47] years) and included 119 821 pupils with {ASD}, of whom 21 660 also had learning difficulties (18.08\%). The standardized prevalence of {ASD} was 1.76\% (95\% {CI}, 1.75\%-1.77\%), with male pupils showing a prevalence of 2.81\% (95\% {CI}, 2.79\%-2.83\%) and female pupils a prevalence of 0.65\% (95\% {CI}, 0.64\%-0.66\%), for a male-to-female ratio ({MFR}) of 4.32:1. Standardized prevalence was highest in Black pupils (2.11\% [95\% {CI}, 2.06\%-2.16\%]; {MFR}, 4.68:1) and lowest in Roma/Irish Travelers (0.85\% [95\% {CI}, 0.67\%-1.03\%]; {MFR}, 2.84:1). Pupils with {ASD} were more likely to face social disadvantage (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.61; 95\% {CI}, 1.59-1.63) and to speak English as an additional language (adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.64; 95\% {CI}, 0.63-0.65). The effect of race/ethnicity on {ASD} status was mediated mostly through social disadvantage, with Black pupils having the largest effect (standardized mediation coefficient, 0.018; P {\textbackslash}textless .001) and 12.41\% of indirect effects through this way. {CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: These findings suggest that significant differences in {ASD} prevalence exist across racial/ethnic groups and geographic areas and local authority districts, indicating possible differential phenotypic prevalence or differences in detection or referral for racial/ethnic minority groups.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to profile the peripheral biomarkers (tyrosine hydroxylase, {TH}; interleukin-1beta, {IL}-1beta; and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, {TNF}-alpha) for schizophrenia and explore their relations with clinical symptoms. Thirty-nine patients with schizophrenia were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ({PAN}{\textbackslash}{SS}), and 25 siblings and 30 normal healthy subjects were used as controls. The {mRNA} expression levels of {TH}, {IL}-1beta and {TNF}-alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as determined with semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, were all significantly increased in both patients (3-fold) and siblings (2-fold) as compared with normal control. Both {IL}-1beta and {TNF}-alpha were significantly correlated with scores on the general psychopathology subscale of the {PAN}{\textbackslash}{SS}. A significant positive correlation between {IL}-1beta and {TH} expression was found in both sibling and normal controls, but not in patients, while a positive correlation between {IL}-1beta and {TNF}-alpha was significant in all the groups. These results suggest that {TH}, {IL}-1beta and {TNF}-alpha are overexpressed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of schizophrenia patients, perhaps due to the hereditary factors. {IL}-1beta and {TNF}-alpha may influence the symptoms of schizophrenia in the cognition dysfunction and anxiety/depression domains of the {PAN}{\textbackslash}{SS}.

Overall, 3H-dopamine uptake by platelet-rich plasma ({PRP}) from 25 schizophrenic subjects did not differ from 3H-dopamine uptake by {PRP} from 22 nonschizophrenic patients and 61 normal volunteers. In the schizophrenic group, however, there was an increased spread of results with seven values falling outside the range of results observed in the control group. Furthermore, of the patients rated, only for the schizophrenic patients was there an inverse correlation between 3H-dopamine uptake by platelets and the rating for delusions on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms. Thus, 3H-dopamine uptake by platelet seems, in some way, to be linked to be delusional state of the patient. Further study of 3H-dopamine uptake by platelets is warranted in a larger and more diverse group of patients to determine the significance of altered dopamine uptake by platelets from some schizophrenic subjects and the correlation between platelet 3H-dopamine uptake and the delusional state of these subjects.},

Recently, the largest genome-wide association study in {AAs} to date confirmed that six of the Alzheimer's disease ({AD})-related genetic variants originally discovered in {EA} cohorts are also risk variants in {AA}; however, the risk attributable to many of the loci (e.g., {APOE}, {ABCA}7) differed substantially from previous studies in {EA}. There likely are risk variants of higher frequency in {AAs} that have not been discovered. {METHODS}: We performed a comprehensive analysis of genetically determined local and global ancestry in {AAs} with regard to {LOAD} status. {RESULTS}: Compared to controls, {LOAD} cases showed higher levels of African ancestry, both globally and at several {LOAD} relevant loci, which explained risk for {AD} beyond global differences. {DISCU}{\textbackslash}{SSION}: Exploratory post hoc analyses highlight regions with greatest differences in ancestry as potential candidate regions for future genetic analyses.

	abstract = {Schizophrenia ({SCZ}) is a brain disorder originating during neurodevelopment with complex genetic and environmental etiologies. Despite decades of clinical evidence of altered striatal function in affected patients, its cellular and molecular underpinnings remain unclear. Here, to explore neurodevelopmental alterations in the striatum associated with {SCZ}, we established a method for the differentiation of {iPS} cells into ventral forebrain organoids. Given substantial genetic heterogeneity among individuals, which can obscure disease-associated phenotypes, we generated organoids from postmortem dural fibroblast-derived {iPS} cells of 3 patients and 4 healthy control individuals with nonoverlapping polygenic risk score ({PRS}) for {SCZ} and whose genotype and postmortem caudate transcriptomic data were profiled in the Brainseq neurogenomics consortium. Single cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) analyses of the organoids revealed differences in developmental trajectory between {SCZ} cases and controls in which inhibitory neurons from patients exhibited accelerated maturation. Furthermore, we found a significant overlap of genes upregulated in the inhibitory neurons in {SCZ} organoids with upregulated genes in postmortem caudate tissues from patients with {SCZ} compared with control individuals, including the donors of our {iPS} cell cohort. Our findings suggest that striatal neurons in the patients with {SCZ} carry abnormalities that originated during early brain development and a ventral forebrain striatal organoid model can recapitulate those neurodevelopmental phenotypes in a dish.},

	abstract = {The growing availability of single-cell data, especially transcriptomics, has sparked an increased interest in the inference of cell-cell communication. Many computational tools were developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we systematically compare 16 cell-cell communication inference resources and 7 methods, plus the consensus between the methods' predictions. Among the resources, we find few unique interactions, a varying degree of overlap, and an uneven coverage of specific pathways and tissue-enriched proteins. We then examine all possible combinations of methods and resources and show that both strongly influence the predicted intercellular interactions. Finally, we assess the agreement of cell-cell communication methods with spatial colocalisation, cytokine activities, and receptor protein abundance and find that predictions are generally coherent with those data modalities. To facilitate the use of the methods and resources described in this work, we provide {LIANA}, a {LIgand}-receptor {ANalysis} {frAmework} as an open-source interface to all the resources and methods. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Eosinophils play a key role in the asthma allergic response by releasing cytotoxic molecules such as eosinophil cationic protein ({ECP}) and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin ({EDN}) that generate epithelium damages. {OBJECTIVE}: We sought to identify genetic variants influencing {ECP} and {EDN} levels in asthma-ascertained families. {METHODS}: We performed univariate and bivariate genome-wide association analyses of {ECP} and {EDN} levels in 1018 subjects from the {EGEA} study with follow-up in 153 subjects from the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean study and combined the results of these 2 studies through meta-analysis. We then conducted Bayesian statistical fine mapping together with quantitative trait locus and functional annotation analyses to identify the most likely functional genetic variants and candidate genes. {RESULTS}: We identified 5 genome-wide significant loci (P {\textbackslash}textless 5 × 10-8) including 7 distinct signals associated with {ECP} and/or {EDN} levels. The genes targeted by our fine mapping and functional search include {RNASE}2 and {RNASE}3 (14q11), which encode {EDN} and {ECP}, respectively, and 4 other genes that regulate {ECP} and {EDN} levels. These 4 genes were {JAK}1 (1p31), a transcription factor that plays a key role in the immune response and acts as a potential therapeutic target for eosinophilic asthma; {ARHGAP}25 (2p13), which is involved in leukocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites; {NDUFA}4 (7p21), which encodes a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is involved in cellular response to stress; and {CTSL} (9q22), which is involved in immune response, extracellular remodeling, and allergic inflammation. {CONCLUSION}: Analysis of specific phenotypes produced by eosinophils allows the identification of genes that play a major role in allergic response and inflammation, and offers potential therapeutic targets for asthma.

In this study, we performed an {eQTL} analysis using single-nuclei {RNA} sequencing from 192 individuals in eight brain cell types derived from the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex and white matter. We identified 7,607 {eGenes}, a substantial fraction (46\%, 3,537/7,607) of which show cell-type-specific effects, with strongest effects in microglia. Cell-type-level {eQTLs} affected more constrained genes and had larger effect sizes than tissue-level {eQTLs}. Integration of brain cell type {eQTLs} with genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) revealed novel relationships between expression and disease risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. For most {GWAS} loci, a single gene co-localized in a single cell type, providing new clues into disease etiology. Our findings demonstrate substantial contrast in genetic regulation of gene expression among brain cell types and reveal potential mechanisms by which disease risk genes influence brain disorders. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

The advent of long-read sequencing technologies offers the opportunity to study the role of genetic variation in transcript structure8-16. In this Article, we present a large human long-read {RNA}-seq dataset using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform from 88 samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) tissues and cell lines, complementing the {GTEx} resource. We identified just over 70,000 novel transcripts for annotated genes, and validated the protein expression of 10\% of novel transcripts. We developed a new computational package, {LORALS}, to analyse the genetic effects of rare and common variants on the transcriptome by allele-specific analysis of long reads. We characterized allele-specific expression and transcript structure events, providing new insights into the specific transcript alterations caused by common and rare genetic variants and highlighting the resolution gained from long-read data. We were able to perturb the transcript structure upon knockdown of {PTBP}1, an {RNA} binding protein that mediates splicing, thereby finding genetic regulatory effects that are modified by the cellular environment. Finally, we used this dataset to enhance variant interpretation and study rare variants leading to aberrant splicing patterns. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

Here we propose {ARCHIE}, a summary statistic based sparse canonical correlation analysis method to identify sets of gene-expressions trans-regulated by sets of known trait-related genetic variants. Simulation studies show that compared to standard methods, {ARCHIE} is better suited to identify "core"-like genes through which effects of many other genes may be mediated and can capture disease-specific patterns of genetic associations. By applying {ARCHIE} to publicly available summary statistics from the {eQTLGen} consortium, we identify gene sets which have significant evidence of trans-association with groups of known genetic variants across 29 complex traits. Around half (50.7\%) of the selected genes do not have any strong trans-associations and are not detected by standard methods. We provide further evidence for causal basis of the target genes through a series of follow-up analyses. These results show {ARCHIE} is a powerful tool for identifying sets of genes whose trans-regulation may be related to specific complex traits. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022. The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The presence, magnitude, and significance of sex differences in the human brain are hotly debated topics in the scientific community and popular media. This debate is largely fueled by studies containing strong, opposing conclusions: either little to no evidence exists for sex differences in human neuroanatomy, or there are small-to-moderate differences in the size of certain brain regions that are highly reproducible across cohorts (even after controlling for sex differences in average brain size). Our Commentary uses the specific comparison between two recent large-scale studies that adopt these opposing views-namely the review by Eliot and colleagues (2021) and the direct analysis of ∼ 40k brains by Williams and colleagues (2021)-in an effort to clarify this controversy and provide a framework for conducting this research. First, we review observations that motivate research on sex differences in human neuroanatomy, including potential causes (evolutionary, genetic, and environmental) and effects (epidemiological and clinical evidence for sex-biased brain disorders). We also summarize methodological and empirical support for using structural {MRI} to investigate such patterns. Next, we outline how researchers focused on sex differences can better specify their study design (e.g., how sex was defined, if and how brain size was adjusted for) and results (by e.g., distinguishing sexual dimorphisms from sex differences). We then compare the different approaches available for studying sex differences across a large number of individuals: direct analysis, meta-analysis, and review. We stress that reviews do not account for methodological differences across studies, and that this variation explains many of the apparent inconsistencies reported throughout recent reviews (including the work by Eliot and colleagues). For instance, we show that amygdala volume is consistently reported as male-biased in studies with sufficient sample sizes and appropriate methods for brain size correction. In fact, comparing the results from multiple large direct analyses highlights small, highly reproducible sex differences in the volume of many brain regions (controlling for brain size). Finally, we describe best practices for the presentation and interpretation of these findings. Care in interpretation is important for all domains of science, but especially so for research on sex differences in the human brain, given the existence of broad societal gender-biases and a history of biological data being used justify sexist ideas. As such, we urge researchers to discuss their results from simultaneously scientific and anti-sexist viewpoints. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022. The Author(s).},

No therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional differences in degeneration and adult onset are unknown.

A disease-specific {SINE}-{VNTR}-Alu ({SVA}) retrotransposon insertion occurs within intron 32 of {TAF}1, a subunit of {TFIID} involved in transcription initiation. While all {XDP} males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight {iPSC} lines from three {XDP} female carrier individuals for X chromosome inactivation status and identified clonal lines that express either the wild-type X or {XDP} haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized {XDP}-relevant transcript expression in neurotypical humans, and found that {SVA}-F expression decreases after 30 years of age in the brain and that {TAF}1 is decreased in most female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, {TAF}1 expression is not sexually dimorphic and decreased after adolescence. These findings indicate that regional-, age- and sex-specific mechanisms regulate {TAF}1, highlighting the importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue. We propose that the decreased {TAF}1 expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the {XDP}-specific partial loss of {TAF}1 function in patients, thereby passing a minimum threshold of {TAF}1 function, and triggering degeneration in the neostriatum.Significance {StatementXDP} is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Single cell {RNA}-Sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) has rapidly gained popularity over the last few years for profiling the transcriptomes of thousands to millions of single cells. This technology is now being used to analyse experiments with complex designs including biological replication. One question that can be asked from single cell experiments, which has been difficult to directly address with bulk {RNA}-seq data, is whether the cell type proportions are different between two or more experimental conditions. As well as gene expression changes, the relative depletion or enrichment of a particular cell type can be the functional consequence of disease or treatment. However, cell type proportion estimates from {scRNA}-seq data are variable and statistical methods that can correctly account for different sources of variability are needed to confidently identify statistically significant shifts in cell type composition between experimental conditions. {RESULTS}: We have developed propeller, a robust and flexible method that leverages biological replication to find statistically significant differences in cell type proportions between groups. Using simulated cell type proportions data, we show that propeller performs well under a variety of scenarios. We applied propeller to test for significant changes in cell type proportions related to human heart development, ageing and {COVID}-19 disease severity. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The propeller method is publicly available in the open source speckle R package (https://github.com/phipsonlab/speckle).

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a prevalent mental illness with a high societal burden, complex pathophysiology, and diverse genetic and environmental etiology. Its complexity, polygenicity, and heterogeneity have hindered mechanistic elucidation and the search for new therapeutics. We present a single-cell dissection of schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic changes in the human prefrontal cortex across two independent cohorts, one deeply profiling 48 subjects (361,996 cells), and the other broadly profiling 92 subjects (106,761 cells). We identified 25 cell types that we used to produce a high-resolution atlas of schizophrenia-altered genes and pathways. Excitatory neurons were the most affected cell group, with transcriptional changes converging on neurodevelopment and synapse-related molecular pathways. Differentially expressed gene sets implicate a coherently expressed module of trans-acting regulatory factors involved in neurodevelopment and genetically associated with schizophrenia risk. Transcriptional alterations significantly overlapped with known genetic risk factors, suggesting convergence of rare and common genomic variants on reproducible neuronal population specific alterations in schizophrenia. The severity of transcriptional pathology segregated two populations of schizophrenia subjects in a manner consistent with the expression of specific transcriptional patterns marked by genes involved in synaptic function and chromatin dynamics. Our results provide a high-resolution single cell atlas linking transcriptomic changes within specific cell populations to etiological genetic risk factors, contextualizing established knowledge within the cytoarchitecture of the human cortex and facilitating mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology and heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in multimodal single-cell technologies have enabled simultaneous acquisitions of multiple omics data from the same cell, providing deeper insights into cellular states and dynamics. However, it is challenging to learn the joint representations from the multimodal data, model the relationship between modalities, and, more importantly, incorporate the vast amount of single-modality datasets into the downstream analyses. To address these challenges and correspondingly facilitate multimodal single-cell data analyses, three key tasks have been introduced: Modality prediction, Modality matching {andJoint} embedding. In this work, we present a general Graph Neural Network framework {scMoGNN} to tackle these three tasks and show that {scMoGNN} demonstrates superior results in all three tasks compared with the state-of-the-art and conventional approaches. Our method is an official winner in the overall ranking {ofModality} prediction from {NeurIPS} 2021 Competition (https://openproblems.bio/neurips\_2021/), and all implementations of our methods have been integrated into {DANCE} package (https://github.com/{OmicsML}/dance).},

	abstract = {Rigorously comparing gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same single cells could illuminate the logic of how coupling or decoupling of these mechanisms regulates fate commitment. Here we present {MIRA}, probabilistic multimodal models for integrated regulatory analysis, a comprehensive methodology that systematically contrasts transcription and accessibility to infer the regulatory circuitry driving cells along cell state trajectories. {MIRA} leverages topic modeling of cell states and regulatory potential modeling of individual gene loci. {MIRA} thereby represents cell states in an efficient and interpretable latent space, infers high-fidelity cell state trees, determines key regulators of fate decisions at branch points and exposes the variable influence of local accessibility on transcription at distinct loci. Applied to epidermal differentiation and embryonic brain development from two different multimodal platforms, {MIRA} revealed that early developmental genes were tightly regulated by local chromatin landscape whereas terminal fate genes were titrated without requiring extensive chromatin remodeling. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

	abstract = {Multimodal single-cell sequencing technologies provide unprecedented information on cellular heterogeneity from multiple layers of genomic readouts. However, joint analysis of two modalities without properly handling the noise often leads to overfitting of one modality by the other and worse clustering results than vanilla single-modality analysis. How to efficiently utilize the extra information from single cell multi-omics to delineate cell states and identify meaningful signal remains as a significant computational challenge. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework, named {SAILERX}, for efficient, robust, and flexible analysis of multi-modal single-cell data. {SAILERX} consists of a variational autoencoder with invariant representation learning to correct technical noises from sequencing process, and a multimodal data alignment mechanism to integrate information from different modalities. Instead of performing hard alignment by projecting both modalities to a shared latent space, {SAILERX} encourages the local structures of two modalities measured by pairwise similarities to be similar. This strategy is more robust against overfitting of noises, which facilitates various downstream analysis such as clustering, imputation, and marker gene detection. Furthermore, the invariant representation learning part enables {SAILERX} to perform integrative analysis on both multi- and single-modal datasets, making it an applicable and scalable tool for more general scenarios. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {Previous genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) of stroke - the second leading cause of death worldwide - were conducted predominantly in populations of European ancestry1,2. Here, in cross-ancestry {GWAS} meta-analyses of 110,182 patients who have had a stroke (five ancestries, 33\% non-European) and 1,503,898 control individuals, we identify association signals for stroke and its subtypes at 89 (61 new) independent loci: 60 in primary inverse-variance-weighted analyses and 29 in secondary meta-regression and multitrait analyses. On the basis of internal cross-ancestry validation and an independent follow-up in 89,084 additional cases of stroke (30\% non-European) and 1,013,843 control individuals, 87\% of the primary stroke risk loci and 60\% of the secondary stroke risk loci were replicated (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Effect sizes were highly correlated across ancestries. Cross-ancestry fine-mapping, in silico mutagenesis analysis3, and transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association analyses revealed putative causal genes (such as {SH}3PXD2A and {FURIN}) and variants (such as at {GRK}5 and {NOS}3). Using a three-pronged approach4, we provide genetic evidence for putative drug effects, highlighting F11, {KLKB}1, {PROC}, {GP}1BA, {LAMC}2 and {VCAM}1 as possible targets, with drugs already under investigation for stroke for F11 and {PROC}. A polygenic score integrating cross-ancestry and ancestry-specific stroke {GWASs} with vascular-risk factor {GWASs} (integrative polygenic scores) strongly predicted ischaemic stroke in populations of European, East Asian and African ancestry5. Stroke genetic risk scores were predictive of ischaemic stroke independent of clinical risk factors in 52,600 clinical-trial participants with cardiometabolic disease. Our results provide insights to inform biology, reveal potential drug targets and derive genetic risk prediction tools across ancestries. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022. The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) is predominantly an acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) and remains a significant threat to public health. {COVID}-19 is accompanied by neurological symptoms and cognitive decline, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. As aging induces distinct molecular signatures in the brain associated with cognitive decline in healthy populations, we hypothesized that {COVID}-19 may induce molecular signatures of aging. Here, we performed whole transcriptomic analysis of human frontal cortex, a critical area for cognitive function, in 12 {COVID}-19 cases and age- and sex-matched uninfected controls. {COVID}-19 induces profound changes in gene expression, despite the absence of detectable virus in brain tissue. Pathway analysis shows downregulation of genes involved in synaptic function and cognition and upregulation of genes involved in immune processes. Comparison with five independent transcriptomic datasets of aging human frontal cortex reveals striking similarities between aged individuals and severe {COVID}-19 patients. Critically, individuals below 65 years of age exhibit profound transcriptomic changes not observed among older individuals in our patient cohort. Our data indicate that severe {COVID}-19 induces molecular signatures of aging in the human brain and emphasize the value of neurological follow-up in recovered individuals.},

	abstract = {Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) are predicted to collectively explain 40-50\% of phenotypic variation in human height, but identifying the specific variants and associated regions requires huge sample sizes1. Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4 million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show that 12,111 independent {SNPs} that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common {SNP}-based heritability. These {SNPs} are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90 kb, covering about 21\% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 {SNPs} (or all {SNPs} in the {HapMap} 3 panel2) account for 40\% (45\%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10-20\% (14-24\%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022. The Author(s).},

To reveal cell dynamics orchestrating neural maturation, we profiled human prefrontal cortex gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution from gestation to adulthood. Integrative analyses define the dynamic trajectories of each cell type, revealing major gene expression reconfiguration at the prenatal-to-postnatal transition in all cell types followed by continuous reconfiguration into adulthood and identifying regulatory networks guiding cellular developmental programs, states, and functions. We uncover links between expression dynamics and developmental milestones, characterize the diverse timing of when cells acquire adult-like states, and identify molecular convergence from distinct developmental origins. We further reveal cellular dynamics and their regulators implicated in neurological disorders. Finally, using this reference, we benchmark cell identities and maturation states in organoid models. Together, this captures the dynamic regulatory landscape of human cortical development. Copyright {\textbackslash}copyright 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aim: The economic burden of schizophrenia in the United States ({US}) was estimated at {\textbackslash}155.7 billion in 2013. Since 2013, the {US} experienced significant health care reforms and treatment advances. This study analyzed recent data and literature to update the {US} economic burden estimate for schizophrenia. Methods: Direct and indirect costs associated with schizophrenia were estimated using a prevalence-based approach. Direct health care costs were assessed retrospectively using an exact matched cohort design in the {IBM} Watson Health {MarketScan} databases from October 1, 2015, through December 31, 2019. Patients with schizophrenia (identified using {ICD}-10-{CM} codes F20 and F25) were exactly matched to controls on demographics, insurance type, and index year. Direct non-health care costs were estimated using published literature and government data. Indirect costs were estimated using a human capital approach and the value of quality-adjusted life-years lost. Cost offsets were estimated to account for basic living costs avoided. Excess costs, comparing costs for individuals with and without schizophrenia, were reported in 2019 {USD}. Results: The estimated excess economic burden of schizophrenia in the {US} in 2019 was {\textbackslash}343.2 billion, including {\textbackslash}251.9 billion in indirect costs (73.4\%), {\textbackslash}62.3 billion in direct health care costs (18.2\%), and {\textbackslash}35.0 billion in direct non-health care costs (10.2\%). The largest drivers of indirect costs were caregiving ({\textbackslash}112.3 billion), premature mortality ({\textbackslash}77.9 billion), and unemployment ({\textbackslash}54.2 billion). Cost offsets, representing {\textbackslash}6.0 billion (1.7\%), were subtracted from direct non-health care costs. Conclusions: The estimated burden of schizophrenia in the {US} doubled between 2013 and 2019 and was {\textbackslash}343.2 billion in 2019, highlighting the importance of effective strategies and treatment options to improve the management of this difficult-to-treat patient population. {\textbackslash}copyright Copyright 2022 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.},

	abstract = {Most studies of gene expression in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia have focused on cortical regions, but subcortical nuclei such as the striatum are prominently implicated in the disease, and current antipsychotic drugs target the striatum's dense dopaminergic innervation. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and transcriptional landscape of schizophrenia in the postmortem caudate nucleus of the striatum of 443 individuals (245 neurotypical individuals, 154 individuals with schizophrenia and 44 individuals with bipolar disorder), 210 from African and 233 from European ancestries. Integrating expression quantitative trait loci analysis, Mendelian randomization with the latest schizophrenia genome-wide association study, transcriptome-wide association study and differential expression analysis, we identified many genes associated with schizophrenia risk, including potentially the dopamine D2 receptor short isoform. We found that antipsychotic medication has an extensive influence on caudate gene expression. We constructed caudate nucleus gene expression networks that highlight interactions involving schizophrenia risk. These analyses provide a resource for the study of schizophrenia and insights into risk mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis ({MS}) is a complex dysimmune disorder of the central nervous system. Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) have identified 233 genetic variations associated with {MS} at the genome-wide significant level. Epigenetic studies have pinpointed differentially methylated {CpG} sites in {MS} patients. However, the interplay between genetic risk factors and epigenetic regulation remains elusive. Here, we employed a network model to integrate {GWAS} summary statistics of 14 802 {MS} cases and 26 703 controls with {DNA} methylation profiles from 140 {MS} cases and 139 controls and the human interactome. We identified differentially methylated genes by aggregating additive effects of differentially methylated {CpG} sites within promoter regions. We reconstructed a gene regulatory network ({GRN}) using literature-curated transcription factor knowledge. Colocalization of the {MS} {GWAS} and methylation quantitative trait loci ({mQTL}) was performed to assess the {GRN}. The resultant {MS}-associated {GRN} highlighted several single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) with {GWAS}-{mQTL} colocalization: rs6032663, rs6065926, and rs2024568 of {CD}40 locus, rs9913597 of {STAT}3 locus, and rs887864 and rs741175 of {CIITA} locus. Moreover, synergistic {mQTL} and {eQTL} signals were identified in {CD}40, suggesting gene expression alteration was likely induced by epigenetic changes. Web-based Cell-type Specific Enrichment Analysis of Genes ({WebCSEA}) indicated that the {GRN} was enriched in T follicular helper cells (p-value = 0.0016). Drug target enrichment analysis of annotations from the Therapeutic Target Database ({TTD}) revealed the {GRN} was also enriched with drug target genes (p-value = 3.89 × 10-4), revealing repurposable candidates for {MS} treatment. These candidates included vorinostat ({HDAC}1 inhibitor) and sivelestat ({ELANE} inhibitor), which warrant further investigation. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2022.

Here, we performed single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing to generate a transcriptome atlas of the human hippocampus across the postnatal lifespan. Detailed analyses of astrocytes, oligodendrocyte lineages, and microglia identified subpopulations with distinct molecular signatures and revealed their association with specific physiological functions, age-dependent changes in abundance, and disease relevance. We further characterized spatiotemporal heterogeneity of {GFAP}-enriched astrocyte subpopulations in the hippocampal formation using immunohistology. Leveraging glial subpopulation classifications as a reference map, we revealed the diversity of glia differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells and identified dysregulated genes and pathological processes in specific glial subpopulations in Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). Together, our study significantly extends our understanding of human glial diversity, population dynamics across the postnatal lifespan, and dysregulation in {AD} and provides a reference atlas for stem-cell-based glial differentiation.

	abstract = {Immune dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia ({SZ}). Despite previous studies showing a broad link between immune dysregulation and the central nervous system of {SZ}, the exact relationship has not been completely elucidated. With immune infiltration analysis as an entry point, this study aimed to explore the relationship between schizophrenia and the immune system in more detail from brain regions, immune cells, genes, and pathways. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the hippocampus ({HPC}), prefrontal cortex ({PFC}), and striatum ({STR}) between {SZ} and control groups. Differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}) and functional enrichment analysis showed that three brain regions were closely related to the immune system. Compared with {PFC} and {STR}, there were 20 immune-related genes ({IRGs}) and 42 immune pathways in {HPC}. The results of immune infiltration analysis showed that the differential immune cells in {HPC} were effector memory T (Tem) cells. The correlation of immune-related {DEGs} ({IDEGs}) and immune cells further analysis showed that {NPY}, {BLNK}, {OXTR}, and {FGF}12, were moderately correlated with Tem cells. Functional pathway analysis indicated that these four genes might affect Tem by regulating the {PI}3K-{AKT} pathway and the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway. The receiver operating characteristic curve ({ROC}) analysis results indicated that these four genes had a high diagnostic ability ({AUC}=95.19\%). Finally, the disease animal model was successfully replicated, and further validation was conducted using the real-time {PCR} and the western blot. These results showed that these gene expression changes were consistent with our previous expression profiling. In conclusion, our findings suggested that {HPC} in {SZ} may be more closely related to immune disorders and modulate immune function through Tem, {PI}3K-Akt pathway, and neuroactive ligand-binding receptor interactions. To the best of our knowledge, the Immucell {AI} tool has been applied for the first time to analyze immune infiltration in {SZ}, contributing to a better understanding of the role of immune dysfunction in {SZ} from a new perspective.

Differential expression analysis of genes is a popular, yet insufficient approach, and complementary methods that associate function with cell type are required. Here, we describe {scHumanNet} (https://github.com/netbiolab/{scHumanNet}), a single-cell network analysis platform for resolving cellular heterogeneity across gene functions in humans. Based on cell-type-specific gene networks ({CGNs}) constructed under the guidance of the {HumanNet} reference interactome, {scHumanNet} displayed higher functional relevance to the cellular context than {CGNs} built by other methods on single-cell transcriptome data. Cellular deconvolution of gene signatures based on network compactness across cell types revealed breast cancer prognostic markers associated with T cells. {scHumanNet} could also prioritize genes associated with particular cell types using {CGN} centrality and identified the differential hubness of {CGNs} between disease and healthy conditions. We demonstrated the usefulness of {scHumanNet} by uncovering T-cell-specific functional effects of {GITR}, a prognostic gene for breast cancer, and functional defects in autism spectrum disorder genes specific for inhibitory neurons. These results suggest that {scHumanNet} will advance our understanding of cell-type specificity across human disease genes. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with sexually dimorphic features, including differential symptomatology, drug responsiveness, and male incidence rate. To date, only the prefrontal cortex has been examined in large-scale transcriptome analyses for sex differences in schizophrenia. Here, we examined the {BrainSeq} Consortium {RNA}-sequencing and genotypes for the caudate nucleus (n=399), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}; n=377), and hippocampus (n=394) to characterize sex differences in schizophrenia. We identified genomic features (genes, transcripts, exons, and exon-exon junctions) associated with sex, sex-specific expression in schizophrenia, and sex-interacting expression quantitative trait loci (si-{eQTL}) associated with schizophrenia risk. We found 878 unique genes with sex differences across brain regions, including {ANK}3 , which shows male-biased expression in the caudate nucleus. X-chromosome dosage was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of female and male individuals with schizophrenia. Our sex interaction model revealed 15 novel junctions dysregulated for schizophrenia in a sex-specific manner. Sex-specific schizophrenia analysis identified dozens of expressed, sex-specific features with enrichment in the transcriptional response of cellular stress. Finally, our si-{eQTL} analysis revealed 974 unique genes, 14 of which are associated with schizophrenia risk. Overall, our results increased the number of annotated sex-biased features, identified sex-specific schizophrenia genes, and provided the first annotation of si-{eQTL} in the human {DLPFC} and hippocampus. Altogether, these results point to the importance of sex-informed analysis of sexually dimorphic traits and inform personalized therapeutic strategies in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Large-scale comprehensive single-cell experiments are often resource-intensive and require the involvement of many laboratories and/or taking measurements at various times. This inevitably leads to batch effects, and systematic variations in the data that might occur due to different technology platforms, reagent lots, or handling personnel. Such technical differences confound biological variations of interest and need to be corrected during the data integration process. Data integration is a challenging task due to the overlapping of biological and technical factors, which makes it difficult to distinguish their individual contribution to the overall observed effect. Moreover, the choice of integration method may impact the downstream analyses, including searching for differentially expressed genes. From the existing data integration methods, we selected only those that return the full expression matrix. We evaluated six methods in terms of their influence on the performance of differential gene expression analysis in two single-cell datasets with the same biological study design that differ only in the way the measurement was done: one dataset manifests strong batch effects due to the measurements of each sample at a different time. Integrated data were visualized using the {UMAP} method. The evaluation was done both on individual gene level using parametric and non-parametric approaches for finding differentially expressed genes and on gene set level using gene set enrichment analysis. As an evaluation metric, we used two correlation coefficients, Pearson and Spearman, of the obtained test statistics between reference, test, and corrected studies. Visual comparison of {UMAP} plots highlighted {ComBat}-seq, limma, and {MNN}, which reduced batch effects and preserved differences between biological conditions. Most of the tested methods changed the data distribution after integration, which negatively impacts the use of parametric methods for the analysis. Two algorithms, {MNN} and Scanorama, gave very poor results in terms of differential analysis on gene and gene set levels. Finally, we highlight {ComBat}-seq as it led to the highest correlation of test statistics between reference and corrected dataset among others. Moreover, it does not distort the original distribution of gene expression data, so it can be used in all types of downstream analyses.

Merging evidence indicate that such constitutional alterations, albeit occurring at a low mosaic level, may confer risk of disease later in life. Given their inherently low incidence rate and mosaic nature, there is a need for bioinformatic tools specifically designed to analyse such events. {RESULTS}: We have developed a method (ramr) to identify aberrantly methylated {DNA} regions ({AMRs}). ramr can be applied to methylation data obtained by array or next-generation sequencing techniques to discover {AMRs} being associated with elevated risk of cancer as well as other diseases. We assessed accuracy and performance metrics of ramr and confirmed its applicability for analysis of large public data sets. Using ramr we identified aberrantly methylated regions that are known or may potentially be associated with development of colorectal cancer and provided functional annotation of {AMRs} that arise at early developmental stages. {AVAILABILITY}: The R package is freely available at https://github.com/{BBCG}/ramr and https://bioconductor.org/packages/ramr. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2021.

We comprehensively evaluated {SuSiEx} using simulations, a range of quantitative traits measured in both {UK} Biobank and Taiwan Biobank, and schizophrenia {GWAS} across East Asian and European ancestries.

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease ({PD}) is a neurodegenerative disease with unknown cause in the majority of patients, who are therefore considered "idiopathic" ({IPD}). {PD} predominantly affects dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta ({SNpc}), yet the pathology is not limited to this cell type. Advancing age is considered the main risk factor for the development of {IPD} and greatly influences the function of microglia, the immune cells of the brain. With increasing age, microglia become dysfunctional and release pro-inflammatory factors into the extracellular space, which promote neuronal cell death. Accordingly, neuroinflammation has also been described as a feature of {PD}. So far, studies exploring inflammatory pathways in {IPD} patient samples have primarily focused on blood-derived immune cells or brain sections, but rarely investigated patient microglia in vitro. Accordingly, we decided to explore the contribution of microglia to {IPD} in a comparative manner using, both, {iPSC}-derived cultures and postmortem tissue. Our meta-analysis of published {RNAseq} datasets indicated an upregulation of {IL}10 and {IL}1B in nigral tissue from {IPD} patients. We observed increased expression levels of these cytokines in microglia compared to neurons using our single-cell midbrain atlas. Moreover, {IL}10 and {IL}1B were upregulated in {IPD} compared to control microglia. Next, to validate these findings in vitro, we generated {IPD} patient microglia from {iPSCs} using an established differentiation protocol. {IPD} microglia were more readily primed as indicated by elevated {IL}1B and {IL}10 gene expression and higher {mRNA} and protein levels of {NLRP}3 after {LPS} treatment. In addition, {IPD} microglia had higher phagocytic capacity under basal conditions-a phenotype that was further exacerbated upon stimulation with {LPS}, suggesting an aberrant microglial function. Our results demonstrate the significance of microglia as the key player in the neuroinflammation process in {IPD}. While our study highlights the importance of microglia-mediated inflammatory signaling in {IPD}, further investigations will be needed to explore particular disease mechanisms in these cells.

We apply this machine-learning-based approach, {CellOracle}, to well-established paradigms-mouse and human haematopoiesis, and zebrafish embryogenesis-and we correctly model reported changes in phenotype that occur as a result of transcription factor perturbation. Through systematic in silico transcription factor perturbation in the developing zebrafish, we simulate and experimentally validate a previously unreported phenotype that results from the loss of noto, an established notochord regulator. Furthermore, we identify an axial mesoderm regulator, lhx1a. Together, these results show that {CellOracle} can be used to analyse the regulation of cell identity by transcription factors, and can provide mechanistic insights into development and differentiation. {\textbackslash}copyright 2023.

	abstract = {Joint fine-mapping that leverages information between quantitative traits could improve accuracy and resolution over single-trait fine-mapping. Using summary statistics, flashfm (flexible and shared information fine-mapping) fine-maps signals for multiple traits, allowing for missing trait measurements and use of related individuals. In a Bayesian framework, prior model probabilities are formulated to favour model combinations that share causal variants to capitalise on information between traits. Simulation studies demonstrate that both approaches produce broadly equivalent results when traits have no shared causal variants. When traits share at least one causal variant, flashfm reduces the number of potential causal variants by 30\% compared with single-trait fine-mapping. In a Ugandan cohort with 33 cardiometabolic traits, flashfm gave a 20\% reduction in the total number of potential causal variants from single-trait fine-mapping. Here we show flashfm is computationally efficient and can easily be deployed across publicly available summary statistics for signals in up to six traits. {\textbackslash}copyright 2021.

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.78530},
	abstract = {The human gut microbiome contains a diversity of microbial species that varies in composition over time and across individuals. These species (and strains within species) can migrate across hosts and evolve by mutation and recombination within hosts. How the ecological process of community assembly interacts with intra-species diversity and evolutionary change is a longstanding question. Two contrasting hypotheses have been proposed based on ecological observations and theory: Diversity Begets Diversity ({DBD}), in which taxa tend to become more diverse in already diverse communities, and Ecological Controls ({EC}), in which higher community diversity impedes diversification within taxa. Previously, using 16S {rRNA} gene amplicon data across a range of environments, we showed a generally positive relationship between taxa diversity and community diversity at higher taxonomic levels, consistent with the predictions of {DBD} (Madi et al., 2020). However, this positive 'diversity slope' reaches a plateau at high levels of community diversity. Here we show that this general pattern holds at much finer genetic resolution, by analyzing intra-species strain and nucleotide variation in static and temporally sampled shotgun-sequenced fecal metagenomes from cohorts of healthy human hosts. We find that both intra-species polymorphism and strain number are positively correlated with community Shannon diversity. This trend is consistent with {DBD}, although we cannot exclude abiotic drivers of diversity. Shannon diversity is also predictive of increases in polymorphism over time scales up to ∼4-6 months, after which the diversity slope flattens and then becomes negative-consistent with {DBD} eventually giving way to {EC}. Also supporting a complex mixture of {DBD} and {EC}, the number of strains per focal species is positively associated with Shannon diversity but negatively associated with richness. Finally, we show that higher community diversity predicts gene loss in a focal species at a future time point. This observation is broadly consistent with the Black Queen Hypothesis, which posits that genes with functions provided by the community are less likely to be retained in a focal species' genome. Together, our results show that a mixture of {DBD}, {EC}, and Black Queen may operate simultaneously in the human gut microbiome, adding to a growing body of evidence that these eco-evolutionary processes are key drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem function. {\textbackslash}copyright 2023, Madi et al.},

Finding candidate causal genes can help in the design of Gene targeted drugs and effectively reduce the risk of the disease. Complex diseases such as {AD} are usually caused by multiple genes. The Genome-wide association study ({GWAS}), has identified the potential genetic variants for most diseases. However, because of linkage disequilibrium ({LD}), it is difficult to identify the causative mutations that directly cause diseases. In this study, we combined expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}) studies with the {GWAS}, to comprehensively define the genes that cause Alzheimer disease. The method used was the Summary Mendelian randomization ({SMR}), which is a novel method to integrate summarized data. Two {GWAS} studies and five {eQTL} studies were referenced in this paper. We found several candidate {SNPs} that have a strong relationship with {AD}. Most of these {SNPs} overlap in different data sets, providing relatively strong reliability.

Our bioinformatic analysis identified discrete glial, immune, neuronal and vascular cell populations spanning Alzheimer's disease and controls. Astrocytes and microglia displayed the greatest transcriptomic impacts, with the induction of both shared and distinct gene programs. Copyright: {\textbackslash}copyright 2023 Soreq et al.

	abstract = {Individuals of admixed ancestries (for example, African Americans) inherit a mosaic of ancestry segments (local ancestry) originating from multiple continental ancestral populations. This offers the unique opportunity of investigating the similarity of genetic effects on traits across ancestries within the same population. Here we introduce an approach to estimate correlation of causal genetic effects (radmix) across local ancestries and analyze 38 complex traits in African-European admixed individuals (N = 53,001) to observe very high correlations (meta-analysis radmix = 0.95, 95\% credible interval 0.93-0.97), much higher than correlation of causal effects across continental ancestries. We replicate our results using regression-based methods from marginal genome-wide association study summary statistics. We also report realistic scenarios where regression-based methods yield inflated heterogeneity-by-ancestry due to ancestry-specific tagging of causal effects, and/or polygenicity. Our results motivate genetic analyses that assume minimal heterogeneity in causal effects by ancestry, with implications for the inclusion of ancestry-diverse individuals in studies. {\textbackslash}copyright 2023.

To provide insight into the molecular regulation of S100{\textbackslash}beta and its potential causal associations with Alzheimer's disease, we carried out genome- and epigenome-wide association studies ({GWAS}/{EWAS}) of serum S100{\textbackslash}beta levels in older adults and performed Mendelian randomisation with Alzheimer's disease. Methods: {GWAS} (N=769, mean age 72.5 years, sd = 0.7) and {EWAS} (N=722, mean age 72.5 years, sd = 0.7) of S100{\textbackslash}beta levels were performed in participants from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Conditional and joint analysis ({COJO}) was used to identify independent loci. Expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}) analyses were performed for lead loci that had genome-wide significant associations with S100{\textbackslash}beta. Bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomisation was used to test for causal associations between S100{\textbackslash}beta and Alzheimer's disease. Colocalisation between S100{\textbackslash}beta and Alzheimer's disease {GWAS} loci was also examined. Results: We identified 154 {SNPs} from chromosome 21 that associated (P{\textbackslash}textless 5x10 -8) with S100{\textbackslash}beta protein levels. The lead variant was located in the S100{\textbackslash}beta gene (rs8128872, P=5.0x10 -17). We found evidence that two independent causal variants existed for both transcription of S100{\textbackslash}beta and S100{\textbackslash}beta protein levels in our {eQTL} analyses . No {CpG} sites were associated with S100{\textbackslash}beta levels at the epigenome-wide significant level (P{\textbackslash}textless 3.6x10 -8); the lead probe was cg06833709 (P=5.8x10 -6), which mapped to the {LGI}1 gene. There was no evidence of a causal association between S100{\textbackslash}beta levels and Alzheimer's disease or vice versa and no evidence for colocalisation between S100{\textbackslash}beta and Alzheimer's disease loci. Conclusions: These data provide insight into the molecular regulators of S100{\textbackslash}beta levels. This context may aid in understanding the role of S100{\textbackslash}beta in brain inflammation and neurological disease. Copyright: {\textbackslash}copyright 2022 A Gadd D et al.},

Here we present {RegTools} ( www.regtools.org ), a computationally efficient, free, and open-source software package designed to integrate somatic variants from genomic data with splice junctions from bulk or single cell transcriptomic data to identify variants that may cause aberrant splicing. We apply {RegTools} to over 9000 tumor samples with both tumor {DNA} and {RNA} sequence data. {RegTools} discovers 235,778 events where a splice-associated variant significantly increases the splicing of a particular junction, across 158,200 unique variants and 131,212 unique junctions. To characterize these somatic variants and their associated splice isoforms, we annotate them with the Variant Effect Predictor, {SpliceAI}, and Genotype-Tissue Expression junction counts and compare our results to other tools that integrate genomic and transcriptomic data. While many events are corroborated by the aforementioned tools, the flexibility of {RegTools} also allows us to identify splice-associated variants in known cancer drivers, such as {TP}53, {CDKN}2A, and B2M, and other genes. {\textbackslash}copyright 2023.

Single-cell transcriptomics data can now be complemented by chromatin accessibility, surface protein expression, adaptive immune receptor repertoire profiling and spatial information. The increasing availability of single-cell data across modalities has motivated the development of novel computational methods to help analysts derive biological insights. As the field grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to navigate the vast landscape of tools and analysis steps. Here, we summarize independent benchmarking studies of unimodal and multimodal single-cell analysis across modalities to suggest comprehensive best-practice workflows for the most common analysis steps. Where independent benchmarks are not available, we review and contrast popular methods.

Although numerous methods have been developed for inferring {GRNs} from {scRNA}-seq data, it is still a challenge to deal with cellular heterogeneity. {RESULTS}: To address this challenge, we developed an interpretable transformer-based method namely {STGRNS} for inferring {GRNs} from {scRNA}-seq data. In this algorithm, gene expression motif technique was proposed to convert gene pairs into contiguous sub-vectors, which can be used as input for the transformer encoder. By avoiding missing phase-specific regulations in a network, gene expression motif can improve the accuracy of {GRN} inference for different types of {scRNA}-seq data. To assess the performance of {STGRNS}, we implemented the comparative experiments with some popular methods on extensive benchmark datasets including 21 static and 27 time-series {scRNA}-seq dataset. All the results show that {STGRNS} is superior to other comparative methods. In addition, {STGRNS} was also proved to be more interpretable than "black box" deep learning methods, which are well-known for the difficulty to explain the predictions clearly. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The source code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanglab-wbgcas/{STGRNS}. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) technology attracts extensive attention in the biomedical field. It can be used to measure gene expression and analyze the transcriptome at the single-cell level, enabling the identification of cell types based on unsupervised clustering. Data imputation and dimension reduction are conducted before clustering because {scRNA}-seq has a high 'dropout' rate, noise and linear inseparability. However, independence of dimension reduction, imputation and clustering cannot fully characterize the pattern of the {scRNA}-seq data, resulting in poor clustering performance. Herein, we propose a novel and accurate algorithm, {\textbackslash}{SSNMDI}, that utilizes a joint learning approach to simultaneously perform imputation, dimensionality reduction and cell clustering in a non-negative matrix factorization ({NMF}) framework. In addition, we integrate the cell annotation as prior information, then transform the joint learning into a semi-supervised {NMF} model. Through experiments on 14 datasets, we demonstrate that {\textbackslash}{SSNMDI} has a faster convergence speed, better dimensionality reduction performance and a more accurate cell clustering performance than previous methods, providing an accurate and robust strategy for analyzing {scRNA}-seq data. Biological analysis are also conducted to validate the biological significance of our method, including pseudotime analysis, gene ontology and survival analysis. We believe that we are among the first to introduce imputation, partial label information, dimension reduction and clustering to the single-cell field. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The source code for {\textbackslash}{SSNMDI} is available at https://github.com/yushanqiu/{\textbackslash}{SSNMDI}. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying diseases in ancestrally diverse populations is a critical step towards the realization of the global application of precision medicine. The African and African admixed populations enable mapping of complex traits given their greater levels of genetic diversity, extensive population substructure, and distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns. {METHODS}: Here we perform a comprehensive genome-wide assessment of Parkinson's disease ({PD}) in 197,918 individuals (1,488 cases; 196,430 controls) of African and African admixed ancestry, characterizing population-specific risk, differential haplotype structure and admixture, coding and structural genetic variation and polygenic risk profiling. {FINDINGS}: We identified a novel common risk factor for {PD} and age at onset at the {GBA}1 locus (risk, rs3115534-G; {OR}=1.58, 95\% {CI} = 1.37 - 1.80, P=2.397E-14; age at onset, {BETA} =-2.004, {SE} =0.57, P = 0.0005), that was found to be rare in non-African/African admixed populations. Downstream short- and long-read whole genome sequencing analyses did not reveal any coding or structural variant underlying the {GWAS} signal. However, we identified that this signal mediates {PD} risk via expression quantitative trait locus ({eQTL}) mechanisms. While previously identified {GBA}1 associated disease risk variants are coding mutations, here we suggest a novel functional mechanism consistent with a trend in decreasing glucocerebrosidase activity levels. Given the high population frequency of the underlying signal and the phenotypic characteristics of the homozygous carriers, we hypothesize that this variant may not cause Gaucher disease. Additionally, the prevalence of Gaucher's disease in Africa is low. {INTERPRETATION}: The present study identifies a novel African-ancestry genetic risk factor in {GBA}1 as a major mechanistic basis of {PD} in the African and African admixed populations. This striking result contrasts to previous work in Northern European populations, both in terms of mechanism and attributable risk. This finding highlights the importance of understanding population-specific genetic risk in complex diseases, a particularly crucial point as the field moves toward precision medicine in {PD} clinical trials and while recognizing the need for equitable inclusion of ancestrally diverse groups in such trials. Given the distinctive genetics of these underrepresented populations, their inclusion represents a valuable step towards insights into novel genetic determinants underlying {PD} etiology. This opens new avenues towards {RNA}-based and other therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing lifetime risk. {EVIDENCE} {BEFORE} {THIS} {STUDY}: Our current understanding of Parkinson's disease ({PD}) is disproportionately based on studying populations of European ancestry, leading to a significant gap in our knowledge about the genetics, clinical characteristics, and pathophysiology in underrepresented populations. This is particularly notable in individuals of African and African admixed ancestries. Over the last two decades, we have witnessed a revolution in the research area of complex genetic diseases. In the {PD} field, large-scale genome-wide association studies in the European, Asian, and Latin American populations have identified multiple risk loci associated with disease. These include 78 loci and 90 independent signals associated with {PD} risk in the European population, nine replicated loci and two novel population-specific signals in the Asian population, and a total of 11 novel loci recently nominated through multi-ancestry {GWAS} efforts.Nevertheless, the African and African admixed populations remain completely unexplored in the context of {PD} genetics. {ADDED} {VALUE} {OF} {THIS} {STUDY}: To address the lack of diversity in our research field, this study aimed to conduct the first genome-wide assessment of {PD} genetics in the African and African admixed populations. Here, we identified a genetic risk factor linked to {PD} etiology, dissected African-specific differences in risk and age at onset, characterized known genetic risk factors, and highlighted the utility of the African and African admixed risk haplotype substructure for future fine-mapping efforts. We identified a novel disease mechanism via expression changes consistent with decreased {GBA}1 activity levels. Future large scale single cell expression studies should investigate the neuronal populations in which expression differences are most prominent. This novel mechanism may hold promise for future efficient {RNA}-based therapeutic strategies such as antisense oligonucleotides or short interfering {RNAs} aimed at preventing and decreasing disease risk. We envisage that these data generated under the umbrella of the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program ({GP}2) will shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in the disease process and might pave the way for future clinical trials and therapeutic interventions. This work represents a valuable resource in an underserved population, supporting pioneering research within {GP}2 and beyond. Deciphering causal and genetic risk factors in all these ancestries will help determine whether interventions, potential targets for disease modifying treatment, and prevention strategies that are being studied in the European populations are relevant to the African and African admixed populations. {IMPLICATIONS} {OF} {ALL} {THE} {AVAILABLE} {EVIDENCE}: We nominate a novel signal impacting {GBA}1 as the major genetic risk factor for {PD} in the African and African admixed populations. The present study could inform future {GBA}1 clinical trials, improving patient stratification. In this regard, genetic testing can help to design trials likely to provide meaningful and actionable answers.

	abstract = {A majority of the variants identified in genome-wide association studies fall in non-coding regions of the genome, indicating their mechanism of impact is mediated via gene expression. Leveraging this hypothesis, transcriptome-wide association studies ({TWAS}) have assisted in both the interpretation and discovery of additional genes associated with complex traits. However, existing methods for conducting {TWAS} do not take full advantage of the intra-individual correlation inherently present in multi-context expression studies and do not properly adjust for multiple testing across contexts. We introduce {CONTENT}-a computationally efficient method with proper cross-context false discovery correction that leverages correlation structure across contexts to improve power and generate context-specific and context-shared components of expression. We apply {CONTENT} to bulk multi-tissue and single-cell {RNA}-seq data sets and show that {CONTENT} leads to a 42\% (bulk) and 110\% (single cell) increase in the number of genetically predicted genes relative to previous approaches. We find the context-specific component of expression comprises 30\% of heritability in tissue-level bulk data and 75\% in single-cell data, consistent with cell-type heterogeneity in bulk tissue. In the context of {TWAS}, {CONTENT} increases the number of locus-phenotype associations discovered by over 51\% relative to previous methods across 22 complex traits. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022.

Furthermore, these methods are tailored to specific tasks, as distinct single-cell problems are formulated differently. To address these shortcomings, here we present {SIMBA}, a graph embedding method that jointly embeds single cells and their defining features, such as genes, chromatin-accessible regions and {DNA} sequences, into a common latent space. By leveraging the co-embedding of cells and features, {SIMBA} allows for the study of cellular heterogeneity, clustering-free marker discovery, gene regulation inference, batch effect removal and omics data integration. We show that {SIMBA} provides a single framework that allows diverse single-cell problems to be formulated in a unified way and thus simplifies the development of new analyses and extension to new single-cell modalities. {SIMBA} is implemented as a comprehensive Python library ( https://simba-bio.readthedocs.io ). {\textbackslash}copyright 2023.

	abstract = {{UNLABELLED}: Ancestral differences in genomic variation are determining factors in gene regulation; however, most gene expression studies have been limited to European ancestry samples or adjusted for ancestry to identify ancestry-independent associations. We instead examined the impact of genetic ancestry on gene expression and {DNA} methylation ({DNAm}) in admixed African/Black American neurotypical individuals to untangle effects of genetic and environmental factors. Ancestry-associated differentially expressed genes ({DEGs}), transcripts, and gene networks, while notably not implicating neurons, are enriched for genes related to immune response and vascular tissue and explain up to 26\% of heritability for ischemic stroke, 27\% of heritability for Parkinson's disease, and 30\% of heritability for Alzhemier's disease. Ancestry-associated {DEGs} also show general enrichment for heritability of diverse immune-related traits but depletion for psychiatric-related traits. The cell-type enrichments and direction of effects vary by brain region. These {DEGs} are less evolutionarily constrained and are largely explained by genetic variations; roughly 15\% are predicted by {DNAm} variation implicating environmental exposures. We also compared Black and White Americans, confirming most of these ancestry-associated {DEGs}. Our results highlight how environment and genetic background affect genetic ancestry differences in gene expression in the human brain and affect risk for brain illness. {SUMMARY}: We examine the impact of genetic ancestry on gene expression and {DNA} methylation of admixed African/Black Americans, highlighting how genetic and environmental background affect risk for brain illness.},

	abstract = {10 years ago, a detailed analysis showed that only 33\% of genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) results included the X chromosome. Multiple recommendations were made to combat such exclusion. Here, we re-surveyed the research landscape to determine whether these earlier recommendations had been translated. Unfortunately, among the genome-wide summary statistics reported in 2021 in the {NHGRI}-{EBI} {GWAS} Catalog, only 25\% provided results for the X chromosome and 3\% for the Y chromosome, suggesting that the exclusion phenomenon not only persists but has also expanded into an exclusionary problem. Normalizing by physical length of the chromosome, the average number of studies published through November 2022 with genome-wide-significant findings on the X chromosome is ∼1 study/Mb. By contrast, it ranges from ∼6 to ∼16 studies/Mb for chromosomes 4 and 19, respectively. Compared with the autosomal growth rate of ∼0.086 studies/Mb/year over the last decade, studies of the X chromosome grew at less than one-seventh that rate, only ∼0.012 studies/Mb/year. Among the studies that reported significant associations on the X chromosome, we noted extreme heterogeneities in data analysis and reporting of results, suggesting the need for clear guidelines. Unsurprisingly, among the 430 scores sampled from the {PolyGenic} Score Catalog, 0\% contained weights for sex chromosomal {SNPs}. To overcome the dearth of sex chromosome analyses, we provide five sets of recommendations and future directions. Finally, until the sex chromosomes are included in a whole-genome study, instead of {GWASs}, we propose such studies would more properly be referred to as "{AWASs}," meaning "autosome-wide scans."

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder with a different, but not necessarily milder clinical presentation in women as compared to men. These sex differences have largely been attributed to the protective role of estrogens. This article reviews the current state of estrogen research in schizophrenia. {RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Estrogens regulate important pathophysiological pathways in schizophrenia, including dopamine activity, mitochondrial function, and the stress system. Estrogen deficiency is common in both sexes and is associated with increases in psychotic symptoms. Hyperprolactinemia causes secondary estrogen deficiency and can be a reaction to stress, or secondary to prolactin-raising antipsychotics. Therefore, prolactin-sparing antipsychotics should be preferred especially in premenopausal women, who are more prone to hyperprolactinemia. Premenopausal women furthermore require lower doses of antipsychotics than men, since estrogens raise the availability and efficacy of antipsychotics. {SUMMARY}: The past years have established the importance of estrogens in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and have shown its relevance to clinical practice through its influence on antipsychotic drug efficacy. Future research should focus on the neurobiological and clinical effect of contraceptives in premenopausal women with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the potential of estrogen-like augmentation with raloxifene and phytoestrogens in schizophrenia should be established in the coming years.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Neurological disorders are a major and increasing global health challenge, which accounts for a substantial portion of the disease burden worldwide. The aim of this systematic analysis is to present the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of disease burden, epidemiological trends, and attributable risk factors of neurological disorders at global, regional, and national levels. {METHODS}: We extracted data of 18 neurological disorders from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study database. The burden of neurological disorders was measured using the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}), and further described according to age, sex, year, geographical location and socio-demographic Index ({SDI}). All estimates were presented with corresponding 95\% uncertainty intervals ({UIs}). {FINDINGS}: Globally, in 2019, there were nearly 10 million deaths and 349 million {DALYs} due to neurological disorders. Among the 18 neurological disorders, stroke was the biggest contributor to {DALYs} (143232.18 [95\%{UI} 133095.81-153241.82] in thousands) and deaths (6552.72 [95\%{UI} 5995.20-7015.14] in thousands), followed by neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. From 1990 to 2019, the {DALYs} of neurological diseases belonging to the communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional categories showed a sharp decrease, while Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and Parkinson's disease showed a large increase. Neurological disorders exhibited different profiles in different regions and age groups. A significant correlation between the {SDI} and the age-standardized {DALY} rates was also found except for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. In addition, risk factors such as high systolic blood pressure, low birth weight and short gestation period, and metabolic risk contribute significantly to neurological disorders. {INTERPRETATION}: The overall burden of neurological disorders has increased from 1990 to 2019, especially for non-communicable neurological disorders. The substantial variations of burden across regions emphasize the need for region-specific interventional strategies and allocation of resources based on priorities.

We carried out association studies and multivariate analyses including other candidate causal factors of {HP} such as the M235T variant of the angiotensinogen ({AGT}) gene, prepregnancy body mass index ({BMI}), and family history of hypertension in Japanese subjects. One hundred and fourteen patients with severe {HP} and 291 normal pregnancy controls were genotyped. Among primiparous subjects, the frequency of "{AC}+{CC} genotype of {AT}1" was significantly higher in severe {HP} than in the controls. A multivariate analysis with "{AC}+{CC} genotype of {AT}1" and "{TT} genotype of {AGT}" revealed that these were independently associated with primiparous severe {HP}. However, when "family history of hypertension" and "prepregnancy {BMI} {\textbackslash}textgreater or =25" were added as factors examined in the multivariate analysis, only "{TT} genotype of {AGT}" and "family history of hypertension" were found to be independent potent factors.

The entire coding and 3' untranslated regions of the {AT}1 receptor gene (2.2 kb) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and submitted to single-strand conformation polymorphism in 60 hypertensive subjects with a familial susceptibility. We identified five polymorphisms (T573–{\textbackslash}{textgreaterC}, A1062–{\textbackslash}{textgreaterG}, A1166–{\textbackslash}{textgreaterC}, G1517–{\textbackslash}{textgreaterT}, and A1878–{\textbackslash}{textgreaterG}). However, no mutations that alter the encoded amino acid sequence were detected. A case-control study performed on white hypertensive (n = 206; blood pressure, 168 +/- 16/103 +/- 9 mm Hg) and normotensive (n = 298; blood pressure, 122 +/- 10/75 +/- 9 mm Hg) subjects using three of five polymorphisms showed a significant increase in allelic frequency of C1166 in hypertensive subjects (0.36 versus 0.28 for normotensive subjects, chi 2 = 6.8, P {\textbackslash}textless .01). Frequencies for the alleles of the other two polymorphisms (T573–{\textbackslash}{textgreaterC}, A1878–{\textbackslash}{textgreaterG}) were similar in both groups. We performed a linkage study using the affected sib pair method and a highly polymorphic marker of the {AT}1 receptor gene. There was no evidence for linkage in 267 sib pairs analyzed from 138 pedigrees. These findings would be compatible with a common variant of the {AT}1 receptor imparting a small effect on blood pressure; further studies will be needed to address this possibility.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The association between genetic variants on the X chromosome to risk of {COPD} has not been fully explored. We hypothesize that the X chromosome harbors variants important in determining risk of {COPD} related phenotypes and may drive sex differences in {COPD} manifestations. {METHODS}: Using X chromosome data from three {COPD}-enriched cohorts of adult smokers, we performed X chromosome specific quality control, imputation, and testing for association with {COPD} case-control status, lung function, and quantitative emphysema. Analyses were performed among all subjects, then stratified by sex, and subsequently combined in meta-analyses. {RESULTS}: Among 10,193 subjects of non-Hispanic white or European ancestry, a variant near {TMSB}4X, rs5979771, reached genome-wide significance for association with lung function measured by {FEV}1/{FVC} ([Formula: see text] 0.020, {SE} 0.004, p 4.97 × 10-08), with suggestive evidence of association with {FEV}1 ([Formula: see text] 0.092, {SE} 0.018, p 3.40 × 10-07). Sex-stratified analyses revealed X chromosome variants that were differentially trending in one sex, with significantly different effect sizes or directions. {CONCLUSIONS}: This investigation identified loci influencing lung function, {COPD}, and emphysema in a comprehensive genetic association meta-analysis of X chromosome genetic markers from multiple {COPD}-related datasets. Sex differences play an important role in the pathobiology of complex lung disease, including X chromosome variants that demonstrate differential effects by sex and variants that may be relevant through escape from X chromosome inactivation. Comprehensive interrogation of the X chromosome to better understand genetic control of {COPD} and lung function is important to further understanding of disease pathology.

To improve both recall and precision of {TF} identification, we curated and clustered a motif collection with more than 30,000 motifs. We benchmarked {SCENIC}+ on diverse datasets from different species, including human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, {ENCODE} cell lines, melanoma cell states and Drosophila retinal development. Next, we exploit {SCENIC}+ predictions to study conserved {TFs}, enhancers and {GRNs} between human and mouse cell types in the cerebral cortex. Finally, we use {SCENIC}+ to study the dynamics of gene regulation along differentiation trajectories and the effect of {TF} perturbations on cell state. {SCENIC}+ is available at scenicplus.readthedocs.io . {\textbackslash}copyright 2023.

	abstract = {Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in health and disease. However, the lack of physical relationships among dissociated cells has limited its applications. To address this issue, we present {CeLEry} (Cell Location {recovEry}), a supervised deep learning algorithm that leverages gene expression and spatial location relationships learned from spatial transcriptomics to recover the spatial origins of cells in {scRNA}-seq. {CeLEry} has an optional data augmentation procedure via a variational autoencoder, which improves the method's robustness and allows it to overcome noise in {scRNA}-seq data. We show that {CeLEry} can infer the spatial origins of cells in {scRNA}-seq at multiple levels, including 2D location and spatial domain of a cell, while also providing uncertainty estimates for the recovered locations. Our comprehensive benchmarking evaluations on multiple datasets generated from brain and cancer tissues using Visium, {MERSCOPE}, {MERFISH}, and Xenium demonstrate that {CeLEry} can reliably recover the spatial location information for cells using {scRNA}-seq data. {\textbackslash}copyright 2023.

	abstract = {Droplet-based single-cell assays, including single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq), single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing ({snRNA}-seq) and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing ({CITE}-seq), generate considerable background noise counts, the hallmark of which is nonzero counts in cell-free droplets and off-target gene expression in unexpected cell types. Such systematic background noise can lead to batch effects and spurious differential gene expression results. Here we develop a deep generative model based on the phenomenology of noise generation in droplet-based assays. The proposed model accurately distinguishes cell-containing droplets from cell-free droplets, learns the background noise profile and provides noise-free quantification in an end-to-end fashion. We implement this approach in the scalable and robust open-source software package {CellBender}. Analysis of simulated data demonstrates that {CellBender} operates near the theoretically optimal denoising limit. Extensive evaluations using real datasets and experimental benchmarks highlight enhanced concordance between droplet-based single-cell data and established gene expression patterns, while the learned background noise profile provides evidence of degraded or uncaptured cell types. {\textbackslash}copyright 2023.

However, co-regulation of genetic effects on gene expression across tissues impedes distinguishing biologically causal tissues from tagging tissues. In the present study, we introduce tissue co-regulation score regression ({TCSC}), which disentangles causal tissues from tagging tissues by regressing gene-disease association statistics (from transcriptome-wide association studies) on tissue co-regulation scores, reflecting correlations of predicted gene expression across genes and tissues. We applied {TCSC} to 78 diseases/traits (average n = 302,000) and gene expression prediction models for 48 {GTEx} tissues. {TCSC} identified 21 causal tissue-trait pairs at a 5\% false discovery rate ({FDR}), including well-established findings, biologically plausible new findings (for example, aorta artery and glaucoma) and increased specificity of known tissue-trait associations (for example, subcutaneous adipose, but not visceral adipose, and high-density lipoprotein). {TCSC} also identified 17 causal tissue-trait covariance pairs at 5\% {FDR}. In conclusion, {TCSC} is a precise method for distinguishing causal tissues from tagging tissues. {\textbackslash}copyright 2023.

Microglia associations with capillaries suggest they may play a role in the regulation of {CBF} or the blood-brain-barrier ({BBB}). We explored the relationship between microglia and pericytes, a vessel-resident cell type that has a major role in the control of {CBF} and maintenance of the {BBB}, discovering a spatially distinct subset of microglia that closely associate with pericytes. We termed these pericyte-associated microglia ({PEM}). {PEM} are present throughout the brain and spinal cord in {NG}2DsRed × {CX}3 {CR}1+/{GFP} mice, and in the human frontal cortex. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy, we found microglia residing adjacent to pericytes at all levels of the capillary tree and found they can maintain their position for at least 28 days. {PEM} can associate with pericytes lacking astroglial endfeet coverage and capillary vessel width is increased beneath pericytes with or without an associated {PEM}, but capillary width decreases if a pericyte loses a {PEM}. Deletion of the microglia fractalkine receptor ({CX}3 {CR}1) did not disrupt the association between pericytes and {PEM}. Finally, we found the proportion of microglia that are {PEM} declines in the superior frontal gyrus in {AD}. In summary, we identify microglia that specifically associate with pericytes and find these are reduced in number in {AD}, which may be a novel mechanism contributing to vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. {\textbackslash}copyright 2023 The Authors. {GLIA} published by Wiley Periodicals {LLC}.},

	abstract = {Altered microglial states affect neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and disease but remain poorly understood. Here, we report 194,000 single-nucleus microglial transcriptomes and epigenomes across 443 human subjects and diverse Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) pathological phenotypes. We annotate 12 microglial transcriptional states, including {AD}-dysregulated homeostatic, inflammatory, and lipid-processing states. We identify 1,542 {AD}-differentially-expressed genes, including both microglia-state-specific and disease-stage-specific alterations. By integrating epigenomic, transcriptomic, and motif information, we infer upstream regulators of microglial cell states, gene-regulatory networks, enhancer-gene links, and transcription-factor-driven microglial state transitions. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of our predicted homeostatic-state activators induces homeostatic features in human {iPSC}-derived microglia-like cells, while inhibiting activators of inflammation can block inflammatory progression. Lastly, we pinpoint the expression of {AD}-risk genes in microglial states and differential expression of {AD}-risk genes and their regulators during {AD} progression. Overall, we provide insights underlying microglial states, including state-specific and {AD}-stage-specific microglial alterations at unprecedented resolution.

However, currently identified regulatory variants, notably expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}), explain only a small fraction of {GWAS} signals. Here, we show that {GWAS} and cis-{eQTL} hits are systematically different: {eQTLs} cluster strongly near transcription start sites, whereas {GWAS} hits do not. Genes near {GWAS} hits are enriched in key functional annotations, are under strong selective constraint and have complex regulatory landscapes across different tissue/cell types, whereas genes near {eQTLs} are depleted of most functional annotations, show relaxed constraint, and have simpler regulatory landscapes. We describe a model to understand these observations, including how natural selection on complex traits hinders discovery of functionally relevant {eQTLs}. Our results imply that {GWAS} and {eQTL} studies are systematically biased toward different types of variant, and support the use of complementary functional approaches alongside the next generation of {eQTL} studies. {\textbackslash}copyright 2023.

	abstract = {Black people living in the United States suffer disproportionate morbidity and mortality across a wide range of neurologic conditions. Despite common conceptions to the contrary, "race" is a socially defined construct with little genetic validity. Therefore, racial health inequities in neurology ("neurodisparities") are not a consequence of biologic differences between races. Instead, racism and associated social determinants of health are the root of neurodisparities. To date, many neurologists have neglected racism as a root cause of neurologic disease, further perpetuating the problem. Structural racism, largely ignored in current neurologic practice and policy, drives neurodisparities through mediators such as excessive poverty, inferior health insurance, and poorer access to neurologic and preventative care. Interpersonal racism (implicit or explicit) and associated discriminatory practices in neurologic research, workforce advancement, and medical education also exacerbate neurodisparities. Neurologists cannot fulfill their professional and ethical responsibility to care for Black patients without understanding how racism, not biologic race, drives neurodisparities. In our review of race, racism, and race-based disparities in neurology, we highlight the current literature on neurodisparities across a wide range of neurologic conditions and focus on racism as the root cause. We discuss why all neurologists are ethically and professionally obligated to actively promote measures to counteract racism. We conclude with a call for actions that should be implemented by individual neurologists and professional neurologic organizations to mitigate racism and work towards health equity in neurology. {\textbackslash}copyright 2022 American Academy of Neurology.},

Patients were reexamined at short-term (3 to 6 months) or long-term (1 to 2 years) follow-up. {RESULTS}: There were no significant intergroup differences in the {MMSE} scores at the initial evaluation or at short-term follow-up. At long-term follow-up, however, patients with either right or left caudate lesions had significantly lower {MMSE} scores than patients with other subcortical lesions. {CONCLUSIONS}: A significant number of patients with caudate infarction deteriorate in their intellectual function between 1 and 2 years after stroke.

The aim of this study was to explore this finding. {MATERIALS} \& {METHODS}: The caudate nucleus and the hippocampus volumes were measured (both expressed as ratios of intracranial volume) in a total of 257 patients with {SCI} and {MCI} according to the Winblad criteria and {AD} according to {ICD}-10 criteria. Demographic data, cognitive measures, and {APOE}-{\textbackslash}epsilon4 status were collected. {RESULTS}: Compared with non-dementia patients ({SCI} and {MCI}), {AD} patients were older, more of them were female, and they had a larger caudate nucleus volume and smaller hippocampus volume (P{\textbackslash}textless .001). In multiple linear regression analysis, age and female sex were associated with larger caudate nucleus volume, but neither diagnosis nor memory function was. Age, gender, and memory function were associated with hippocampus volume, and age and memory function were associated with caudate nucleus/hippocampus ratio. {CONCLUSIONS}: A larger caudate nucleus volume in {AD} patients was partly explained by older age and being female. These results are further discussed in the context of (1) the caudate nucleus possibly serving as a mechanism for temporary compensation; (2) methodological properties of automated volumetry of this brain region; and (3) neuropathological alterations. Further studies are needed to fully understand the role of the caudate nucleus in {AD}. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 John Wiley \& Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The heritability explained by local ancestry markers in an admixed population (h{\textbackslash}gamma2) provides crucial insight into the genetic architecture of a complex disease or trait. Estimation of h{\textbackslash}gamma2 can be susceptible to biases due to population structure in ancestral populations. Here, we present heritability estimation from admixture mapping summary statistics ({HAMSTA}), an approach that uses summary statistics from admixture mapping to infer heritability explained by local ancestry while adjusting for biases due to ancestral stratification. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that {HAMSTA} h{\textbackslash}gamma2 estimates are approximately unbiased and are robust to ancestral stratification compared to existing approaches. In the presence of ancestral stratification, we show a {HAMSTA}-derived sampling scheme provides a calibrated family-wise error rate ({FWER}) of ∼5\% for admixture mapping, unlike existing {FWER} estimation approaches. We apply {HAMSTA} to 20 quantitative phenotypes of up to 15,988 self-reported African American individuals in the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology ({PAGE}) study. We observe hˆ{\textbackslash}gamma2 in the 20 phenotypes range from 0.0025 to 0.033 (mean hˆ{\textbackslash}gamma2 = 0.012 ± 9.2 × 10-4), which translates to hˆ2 ranging from 0.062 to 0.85 (mean hˆ2 = 0.30 ± 0.023). Across these phenotypes we find little evidence of inflation due to ancestral population stratification in current admixture mapping studies (mean inflation factor of 0.99 ± 0.001). Overall, {HAMSTA} provides a fast and powerful approach to estimate genome-wide heritability and evaluate biases in test statistics of admixture mapping studies.

	abstract = {Heritable diseases often manifest in a highly tissue-specific manner, with different disease loci mediated by genes in distinct tissues or cell types. We propose Tissue-Gene Fine-Mapping ({TGFM}), a fine-mapping method that infers the posterior probability ({PIP}) for each gene-tissue pair to mediate a disease locus by analyzing {GWAS} summary statistics (and in-sample {LD}) and leveraging {eQTL} data from diverse tissues to build cis-predicted expression models; {TGFM} also assigns {PIPs} to causal variants that are not mediated by gene expression in assayed genes and tissues. {TGFM} accounts for both co-regulation across genes and tissues and {LD} between {SNPs} (generalizing existing fine-mapping methods), and incorporates genome-wide estimates of each tissue's contribution to disease as tissue-level priors. {TGFM} was well-calibrated and moderately well-powered in simulations; unlike previous methods, {TGFM} was able to attain correct calibration by modeling uncertainty in cis-predicted expression models. We applied {TGFM} to 45 {UK} Biobank diseases/traits (average N=316K) using {eQTL} data from 38 {GTEx} tissues. {TGFM} identified an average of 147 {PIP} {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.5 causal genetic elements per disease/trait, of which 11\% were gene-tissue pairs. Implicated gene-tissue pairs were concentrated in known disease-critical tissues, and causal genes were strongly enriched in disease-relevant gene sets. Causal gene-tissue pairs identified by {TGFM} recapitulated known biology (e.g., {TPO}-thyroid for Hypothyroidism), but also included biologically plausible novel findings (e.g., {SLC}20A2-artery aorta for Diastolic blood pressure). Further application of {TGFM} to single-cell {eQTL} data from 9 cell types in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}), analyzed jointly with {GTEx} tissues, identified 30 additional causal gene-{PBMC} cell type pairs at {PIP} {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.5-primarily for autoimmune disease and blood cell traits, including the well-established role of {CTLA}4 in {CD}8+ T cells for All autoimmune disease.

	abstract = {{SNP} heritability is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genotyped {SNPs} and is believed to be a lower bound of heritability ( h2 ), being equal to it if all causal variants are known. Despite the simple intuition behind , its interpretation and equivalence to h2 is unclear, particularly in the presence of population structure and assortative mating. It is well known that population structure can lead to inflation in estimates. Here we use analytical theory and simulations to demonstrate that estimated with genome-wide restricted maximum likelihood ({GREML}) can be biased in admixed populations, even in the absence of confounding and even if all causal variants are known. This is because admixture generates linkage disequilibrium ({LD}), which contributes to the genetic variance, and therefore to heritability. {GREML} implicitly assumes this component is zero, which may not be true, particularly for traits under divergent or stabilizing selection in the source populations, leading under- or over-estimates of relative to h2 . For the same reason, {GREML} estimates of local ancestry heritability will also be biased. We describe the bias in and as a function of admixture history and the genetic architecture of the trait and discuss its implications for genome-wide association and polygenic prediction.},

Through benchmark studies on 28 {TCGA} datasets, we demonstrated the superior performance and interpretability of Pathformer on various cancer classification tasks, compared to other integration models.

Haptools supports fast simulation of admixed genomes, visualization of admixture tracks, simulation of haplotype- and local ancestry-specific phenotype effects and a variety of file operations and statistics computed in a haplotype-aware manner. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Haptools is freely available at https://github.com/cast-genomics/haptools. {DOCUMENTATION}: Detailed documentation is available at https://haptools.readthedocs.io. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author(s) 2023.

The All of Us Research Program is a longitudinal cohort study aiming to enrol a diverse group of at least one million individuals across the {USA} to accelerate biomedical research and improve human health5,6. Here we describe the programme's genomics data release of 245,388 clinical-grade genome sequences. This resource is unique in its diversity as 77\% of participants are from communities that are historically under-represented in biomedical research and 46\% are individuals from under-represented racial and ethnic minorities. All of Us identified more than 1 billion genetic variants, including more than 275 million previously unreported genetic variants, more than 3.9 million of which had coding consequences. Leveraging linkage between genomic data and the longitudinal electronic health record, we evaluated 3,724 genetic variants associated with 117 diseases and found high replication rates across both participants of European ancestry and participants of African ancestry. Summary-level data are publicly available, and individual-level data can be accessed by researchers through the All of Us Researcher Workbench using a unique data passport model with a median time from initial researcher registration to data access of 29 hours. We anticipate that this diverse dataset will advance the promise of genomic medicine for all. {\textbackslash}copyright 2024. The Author(s).},

Yet, the pluripotent states and factors involved in the differentiation of {hPSCs} to {TSCs} remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the primed pluripotent state can generate {TSCs} by activating pathways such as Epidermal Growth Factor ({EGF}) and Wingless-related integration site ({WNT}), and by suppressing tumor growth factor beta ({TGFβ}), histone deacetylases ({HDAC}), and Rho-associated protein kinase ({ROCK}) signaling pathways, all without the addition of exogenous Bone morphogenetic protein 4 ({BMP}4)-a condition we refer to as the {TS} condition. We characterized this process using temporal single-cell {RNA} sequencing to compare {TS} conditions with differentiation protocols involving {BMP}4 activation alone or {BMP}4 activation in conjunction with {WNT} inhibition. The {TS} condition consistently produced a stable, proliferative cell type that closely mimics first-trimester placental cytotrophoblasts, marked by the activation of endogenous retroviral genes and the absence of amnion expression. This was observed across multiple cell lines, including various primed induced pluripotent stem cell ({iPSC}) and embryonic stem cell ({ESC}) lines. Primed-derived {TSCs} can proliferate for over 30 passages and further specify into multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts and extravillous trophoblast cells. Our research establishes that the differentiation of primed {hPSCs} to {TSC} under {TS} conditions triggers the induction of {TMSB}4X, {BMP}5/7, {GATA}3, and {TFAP}2A without progressing through a naive state. These findings propose that the primed {hPSC} state is part of a continuum of potency with the capacity to differentiate into {TSCs} through multiple routes.},

The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. {PrediXcan} enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments.

However, due to extensive linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) of the genome, it is challenging to identify causal genetic variations that drive {DNAm} levels by population-based genetic association studies. This limits the utility of {mQTLs} for fine-mapping risk loci underlying psychiatric disorders identified by genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}). Here we present {INTERACT}, a deep learning model that integrates convolutional neural networks with transformer, to predict effects of genetic variations on {DNAm} levels at {CpG} sites in the human brain. We show that {INTERACT}-derived {DNAm} regulatory variants are not confounded by {LD}, are concentrated in regulatory genomic regions in the human brain, and are convergent with {mQTL} evidence from genetic association analysis. We further demonstrate that predicted {DNAm} regulatory variants are enriched for heritability of brain-related traits and improve polygenic risk prediction for schizophrenia across diverse ancestry samples. Finally, we applied predicted {DNAm} regulatory variants for fine-mapping schizophrenia {GWAS} risk loci to identify potential novel risk genes. Our study shows the power of a deep learning approach to identify functional regulatory variants that may elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: Angiotensin (Ang) {II} plays an important role in fibrogenesis in various organs, including the lung. The aim of this study is to elucidate (i) the effects of Ang {II} on the expression of cytokines, growth factors or matrix proteins in normal human lung fibroblasts, and (ii) the inhibitory effects of an Ang {II} type 1 ({AT}1) receptor blocker, candesartan.
{METHODS}: Normal human adult lung fibroblasts were cultured. Candesartan was added and the cells were incubated. All the cells in culture dishes were collected at day 0 and 2, and the cell numbers were counted using a Neubauer haemocytometer (Clay-Adams, Parsippany, {NJ}, {USA}). The cell proliferation rates at day 2 were calculated in comparison to those at day 0. Total cellular {RNA} was extracted for real-time quantitative {PCR}, or the culture supernatant was collected for either a Sircol assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used for analyzing the cells with and without prior exposure to candesartan. Comparisons between the means of multiple groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) followed by Tukey's test or Games-Howell's test. Values of P {\textless} 0*05 were considered to be statistically significant.
{RESULTS}: Among the 12 fibrosis-associated cytokines and growth factors, {mRNA} expressions of interleukin ({IL})-4, {IL}-7, and platelet-derived growth factor-D were significantly modulated by Ang {II}, and suppressed by candesartan. Soluble collagen and elastin levels were significantly elevated by Ang {II}, and suppressed by candesartan. Under confocal microscopy, the intracellular distribution of elastin was significantly increased by Ang {II}, and suppressed by candesartan.
{CONCLUSION}: These data indicate that Ang {II} promotes lung fibrosis by increasing the matrix formation, which was suppressed by {AT}1 receptor blocker.},

Previous studies have shown that angiotensin {II} is involved in the synthesis of type I collagen. We investigated whether the blockade of angiotensin {II} receptor type I ({AT}1 ) by irbesartan reduces skin and lung fibrosis in 2 murine models of {SSc}.
{METHODS}: {SSc} was induced by daily intradermal injection of {HOCl} into the backs of {BALB}/c mice ({HOCl}-induced {SSc}). Mice were treated daily with irbesartan by oral gavage.
{RESULTS}: Irbesartan reduced dermal thickness, collagen concentration, Smad2/3, and α-smooth muscle actin expression, as well as fibroblast proliferation and H-Ras expression in the skin of mice with {HOCl}-induced {SSc}. Mice treated with irbesartan also displayed less lung fibrosis, less inflammation, and a lower concentration of collagen in the lungs than untreated mice. Exhaled nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and 3-nitrotyrosine expression in the lungs were decreased following irbesartan treatment. Moreover, irbesartan reduced the number and the proliferation of splenic B and T cells and the serum levels of anti-{DNA} topoisomerase I autoantibodies.
{CONCLUSION}: Irbesartan, an {AT}1 antagonist, prevents fibrosis and inflammation and inhibits nitric oxide production in {HOCl}-induced models of systemic fibrosis. Our findings extend the indication of an {AT}1 antagonist to {SSc} patients with diffuse fibrosis, especially those with lung involvement.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious lung disorder that can lead to respiratory failure. Here we show that transgenic mice expressing active renin from the liver ({RenTgMK}) developed progressive pulmonary fibrosis leading to impaired pulmonary function. Histological analyses revealed a marked increase in extracellular matrix ({ECM}) deposition and decrease in alveolar size in the lungs of {RenTgMK} mice compared to wild-type ({WT}) littermates, accompanied with increased expression of {ECM} proteins and fibrogenic factors. The increase in lung fibrosis led to a substantial decrease in respiratory system compliance. Two-week treatment with aliskiren (renin inhibitor) or losartan ({AT}1 antagonist) ameliorated pulmonary {ECM} deposition, blocked the induction of {ECM} proteins and fibrogenic factors and improved respiratory compliance in {RenTgMK} mice, confirming a critical role of the renin-Ang {II}-{AT}1 cascade in promoting pulmonary fibrogenesis. However, when {RenTgMK} mice were treated with hydralazine (a smooth muscle relaxant), the blood pressure was normalized but the lung fibrotic abnormalities, fibrogenic gene induction and pulmonary elasticity were not corrected. Moreover, intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide induced more severe lung injury in {RenTgMK} mice compared to {WT} littermates. These observations demonstrate that the renin-angiotensin system is a key mediator of lung fibrosis, and its pro-fibrotic effect is independent of blood pressure.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary arterial adventitial fibroblasts ({PAAFs}) are important regulators of fibrotic vascular remodeling during the progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension ({PAH}), a disease that currently has no effective anti-fibrotic treatments. We conducted in-vitro experiments in {PAAFs} cultured on hydrogels attached to custom-made equibiaxial stretchers at 10\% stretch and substrate stiffnesses representing the mechanical conditions of mild and severe stages of {PAH}. The expression of collagens α(1)I and α(1){III} and elastin messenger {RNAs} (Col1a1, Col3a1, Eln) were upregulated by increased stretch and substrate stiffness, while lysyl oxidase-like 1 and α-smooth muscle actin messenger {RNAs} (Loxl1, Acta2) were only significantly upregulated when the cells were grown on matrices with an elevated stiffness representative of mild {PAH} but not on a stiffness representative of severe {PAH}. Fibronectin messenger {RNA} (Fn1) levels were significantly induced by increased substrate stiffness and transiently upregulated by stretch at 4 h, but was not significantly altered by stretch at 24 h. We modified our published computational network model of the signaling pathways that regulate profibrotic gene expression in {PAAFs} to allow for differential regulation of mechanically-sensitive nodes by stretch and stiffness. When the model was modified so that stiffness activated integrin β3, the Macrophage Stimulating 1 or 2 ({MST}1{\textbackslash}2) kinases, angiotensin {II} (Ang {II}), transforming growth factor-β ({TGF}-β), and syndecan-4, and stretch-regulated integrin β3, {MST}1{\textbackslash}2, Ang {II}, and the transient receptor potential ({TRP}) channel, the model correctly predicted the upregulation of all six genes by increased stiffness and the observed responses to stretch in five out of six genes, although it could not replicate the non-monotonic effects of stiffness on Loxl1 and Acta2 expression. Blocking Ang {II} Receptor Type 1 ({AT}1R) with losartan in-vitro uncovered an interaction between the effects of stretch and stiffness and angiotensin-independent activation of Fn1 expression by stretch in {PAAFs} grown on 3-{kPa} matrices. This novel combination of in-vitro and in-silico models of {PAAF} profibrotic cell signaling in response to altered mechanical conditions may help identify regulators of vascular adventitial remodeling due to changes in stretch and matrix stiffness that occur during the progression of {PAH} in-vivo.},

Using reporter silencing assays, we show that hsa-{miR}-155 down-regulates the expression of only the 1166A, and not the 1166C, allele of rs5186. Remarkably, the 1166C allele has been associated with hypertension in many studies. Thus, the 1166C allele may be functionally associated with hypertension by abrogating regulation by hsa-{miR}-155, thereby elevating {AGTR}1 levels. Since hsa-{miR}-155 is on chromosome 21, we hypothesize that the observed lower blood pressure in trisomy 21 is partially caused by the overexpression of hsa-{miR}-155 leading to allele-specific underexpression of {AGTR}1. Indeed, we have shown in fibroblasts from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 that levels of {AGTR}1 protein are lower in trisomy 21.},

	abstract = {Angiotensin {II} (Ang-{II}) is a widely studied hypertensive, profibrotic, and pro-inflammatory peptide. In the heart, cardiac fibroblasts ({CF}) express type 1 angiotensin {II} receptors ({AT}1R), Toll-like receptor-4 ({TLR}4), and the {NLRP}3 inflammasome complex, which play important roles in pro-inflammatory processes. When activated, the {NLRP}3 inflammasome triggers proteolytic cleavage of pro-{IL}-1, resulting in its activation. However, in {CF} the mechanism by which Ang-{II} assembles and activates the {NLRP}3 inflammasome remains not fully known. To elucidate this important point, we stimulated {TLR}4 receptors in {CF} and evaluated the signaling pathways by which Ang-{II} triggers the assembly and activity. In cultured rat {CF}, pro-{IL}-1β levels, {NLRP}3, {ASC}, and caspase-1 expression levels were determined by Western blot. {NLRP}3 inflammasome complex assembly was analyzed by immunocytochemistry, whereas by {ELISA}, we analyzed {NLRP}3 inflammasome activity and [Formula: see text] release. In {CF}, Ang-{II} triggered {NLRP}3 inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activity; and in {LPS}-pretreated {CF}, Ang-{II} also triggered [Formula: see text] secretion. These effects were blocked by losartan ({AT}1R antagonist), U73221 ({PLC} inhibitor), 2-{APB} ({IP}3R antagonist), and {BAPTA}-{AM} (Ca2+ chelator) indicating that the {AT}1R/{PLC}/{IP}3R/Ca2+ pathway is involved. Finally, bafilomycin A1 prevented Ang-{II}-induced [Formula: see text] secretion, indicating that a non-classical protein secretion mechanism is involved. These findings suggest that in {CF}, Ang-{II} by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism triggers {NLRP}3 inflammasome assembly and activation leading to [Formula: see text] secretion through a non-conventional protein secretion mechanism.},

	abstract = {Despite its known importance in the cardiovascular system, the specific role and impact of the angiotensin type 2 receptor ({AT}2R) in lung physiology and pathophysiology remain largely elusive. In this study, we highlight the distinct and specialized lung-specific roles of {AT}2R, primarily localized to an alveolar fibroblast subpopulation, in contrast to the angiotensin type 1 receptor ({AT}1R), which is almost exclusively expressed in lung pericytes. Evidence from our research demonstrates that the disruption of {AT}2R ({AT}2R-/y), is associated with a surge in oxidative stress and impaired lung permeability, which were further intensified by Hyperoxic Acute Lung Injury ({HALI}). With aging, {AT}2R-/y mice show an increase in oxidative stress, premature enlargement of airspaces, as well as increased mortality when exposed to hyperoxia as compared to age-matched {WT} mice. Our investigation into Losartan, an {AT}1R blocker, suggests that its primary {HALI} lung-protective effects are channeled through {AT}2R, as its protective benefits are absent in {AT}2R-/y mice. Importantly, a non-peptide {AT}2R agonist, Compound 21 (C21), successfully reverses lung oxidative stress and {TGFβ} activation in wild-type ({WT}) mice exposed to {HALI}. These findings suggest a possible paradigm shift in the therapeutic approach for lung injury and age-associated pulmonary dysfunction, from targeting {AT}1R with angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}) towards boosting the protective function of {AT}2R.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) is a prevalent smoking-related disease for which no disease-altering therapies currently exist. As dysregulated {TGF}-β signaling associates with lung pathology in patients with {COPD} and in animal models of lung injury induced by chronic exposure to cigarette smoke ({CS}), we postulated that inhibiting {TGF}-β signaling would protect against {CS}-induced lung injury. We first confirmed that {TGF}-β signaling was induced in the lungs of mice chronically exposed to {CS} as well as in {COPD} patient samples. Importantly, key pathological features of smoking-associated lung disease in patients, e.g., alveolar injury with overt emphysema and airway epithelial hyperplasia with fibrosis, accompanied {CS}-induced alveolar cell apoptosis caused by enhanced {TGF}-β signaling in {CS}-exposed mice. Systemic administration of a {TGF}-β-specific neutralizing antibody normalized {TGF}-β signaling and alveolar cell death, conferring improved lung architecture and lung mechanics in {CS}-exposed mice. Use of losartan, an angiotensin receptor type 1 blocker used widely in the clinic and known to antagonize {TGF}-β signaling, also improved oxidative stress, inflammation, metalloprotease activation and elastin remodeling. These data support our hypothesis that inhibition of {TGF}-β signaling through angiotensin receptor blockade can attenuate {CS}-induced lung injury in an established murine model. More importantly, our findings provide a preclinical platform for the development of other {TGF}-β-targeted therapies for patients with {COPD}.},

            Common genetic variants confer substantial risk for chronic lung diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. Defining the genetic control of gene expression in a cell-type-specific and context-dependent manner is critical for understanding the mechanisms through which genetic variation influences complex traits and disease pathobiology. To this end, we performed single-cell {RNA} sequencing of lung tissue from 66 individuals with pulmonary fibrosis and 48 unaffected donors. Using a pseudobulk approach, we mapped expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTLs}) across 38 cell types, observing both shared and cell-type-specific regulatory effects. Furthermore, we identified disease interaction {eQTLs} and demonstrated that this class of associations is more likely to be cell-type-specific and linked to cellular dysregulation in pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, we connected lung disease risk variants to their regulatory targets in disease-relevant cell types. These results indicate that cellular context determines the impact of genetic variation on gene expression and implicates context-specific {eQTLs} as key regulators of lung homeostasis and disease.},

              The
              Drd2
              gene, encoding the dopamine D
              2
              receptor (D2R), was recently indicated as a potential target in the etiology of lowered sociability (i.e., social withdrawal), a symptom of several neuropsychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia and Major Depression. Many animal species show social withdrawal in response to stimuli, including the vinegar fly
              Drosophila melanogaster
              and mice, which also share most human disease-related genes. Here we will test for causality between
              Drd2
              and sociability and for its evolutionary conserved function in these two distant species, as well as assess its mechanism as a potential therapeutic target. During behavioral observations in groups of freely interacting
              D. melanogaster
              ,
              Drd2
              homologue mutant showed decreased social interactions and locomotor activity. After confirming
              Drd2
              ’s social effects in flies, conditional transgenic mice lacking
              Drd2
              in dopaminergic cells (autoreceptor {KO}) or in serotonergic cells (heteroreceptor {KO}) were studied in semi-natural environments, where they could freely interact. Autoreceptor {KOs} showed increased sociability, but reduced activity, while no overall effect of
              Drd2
              deletion was observed in heteroreceptor {KOs}. To determine acute effects of D2R signaling on sociability, we also showed that a direct intervention with the D2R agonist Sumanirole decreased sociability in wild type mice, while the antagonist showed no effects. Using a computational ethological approach, this study demonstrates that
              Drd2
              regulates sociability across evolutionary distant species, and that activation of the mammalian D2R autoreceptor, in particular, is necessary for social functioning.},

	abstract = {As the world's population ages, the prevalence of age-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is increasing. There is currently no treatment for Alzheimer's disease, and the few approved medications have a low success rate in lowering symptoms. As a result, several attempts are underway worldwide to identify new targets for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease. In preclinical studies of Alzheimer's disease, it was recently found that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) and blocking of the angiotensin {II} receptors reduce symptoms of neurodegeneration, Aβ plaque development, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Angiotensin {II} type I ({AT}1) blockers, such as telmisartan, candesartan, valsartan, and others, have a wide safety margin and are commonly used to treat hypertension. Renal and cardiovascular failures are reduced due to their vascular protective actions. Inhibition of {AT}1 receptors in the brain has a neuroprotective impact in humans, reducing the risk of stroke, increasing cognition, and slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Although their effect is evident in preclinical studies, clinical trials, on the other hand, are in short supply to validate the strategy. More dose-response experiments with possible {AT}1 blockers and brain-targeted administration will be needed in the future.},

{OBJECTIVE}: To test the efficacy of losartan to reduce lung injury in hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: This blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 13 hospitals in the United States from April 2020 to February 2021. Hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19 and a respiratory sequential organ failure assessment score of at least 1 and not already using a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ({RAAS}) inhibitor were eligible for participation. Data were analyzed from April 19 to August 24, 2021.
{INTERVENTIONS}: Losartan 50 mg orally twice daily vs equivalent placebo for 10 days or until hospital discharge.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: The primary outcome was the imputed arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2:Fio2) ratio at 7 days. Secondary outcomes included ordinal {COVID}-19 severity; days without supplemental o2, ventilation, or vasopressors; and mortality. Losartan pharmacokinetics and {RAAS} components ({AII}, angiotensin-[1-7] and angiotensin-converting enzymes 1 and 2)] were measured in a subgroup of participants.
{RESULTS}: A total of 205 participants (mean [{SD}] age, 55.2 [15.7] years; 123 [60.0\%] men) were randomized, with 101 participants assigned to losartan and 104 participants assigned to placebo. Compared with placebo, losartan did not significantly affect Pao2:Fio2 ratio at 7 days (difference, -24.8 [95\%, -55.6 to 6.1]; P = .12). Compared with placebo, losartan did not improve any secondary clinical outcomes and led to fewer vasopressor-free days than placebo (median [{IQR}], 9.4 [9.1-9.8] vasopressor-free days vs 8.7 [8.2-9.3] vasopressor-free days).
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: This randomized clinical trial found that initiation of orally administered losartan to hospitalized patients with {COVID}-19 and acute lung injury did not improve Pao2:Fio2 ratio at 7 days. These data may have implications for ongoing clinical trials.

However, there currently exists limited "pooled" data examining the long-term efficacy of {ARB} treatment in controlling {BP} or mitigating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the long-term effects of {ARBs} as a class on {BP} control, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, cerebrovascular events (ie, stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, {PubMed}, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to March 2015. Two evaluators independently reviewed studies for eligibility. Randomized controlled hypertension trials were included if they reported on {ARB} efficacy in either {BP} control (relative to placebo for periods ≥ 6 months) or cardiovascular/cerebrovascular outcomes (relative to non-{ARB} antihypertensive therapies for periods ≥ 24 months). Studies were pooled with a random-effects model using weighted mean differences ({WMDs}) and relative risks for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. A total of 11 articles were included in the narrative synthesis, representing seven unique trials (16,864 participants). Six {ARB} agents were studied: candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, losartan (each represented by one trial arm), and telmisartan (represented by two arms). {ARB} therapy significantly reduced mean systolic {BP} ({WMD}: -4.86; 95\% {CI}: -6.19, -3.53 mm Hg) and diastolic {BP} ({WMD}: -2.75; 95\% {CI}: -3.65, -1.86 mm Hg] compared to placebo. The risk of stroke was reduced by 21\% in the {ARB} group compared with alternative antihypertensives (risk ratio: 0.79; 95\% {CI}: 0.66, 0.96). {ARBs} did not, however, produce statistically significant reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, or mortality. Our findings suggest that {ARBs}, as a class, are more effective than placebo therapy in long-term {BP} lowering in patients with essential hypertension. Long-term {ARB} treatment may also confer enhanced protection against stroke but not other cardiovascular outcomes relative to placebo.},

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, to reduce emphysema progression. Methods: The trial was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted between May 2017 and January 2021. Eligible participants were aged ⩾40 years, had moderate to severe airflow obstruction, ⩾10 pack-years of smoking, mild-moderate emphysema on high-resolution computed tomography, and no medical indication for or intolerance of angiotensin receptor blockers. Treatment with losartan 100 mg daily or matching placebo (1:1) was randomly assigned. The primary outcome was emphysema progression on high-resolution computed tomography over 48 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, the {COPD} Assessment Test, and the Physical Function-Short Form 20a. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 220 participants were enrolled; 58\% were men, 19\% were African American, and 24\% were current smokers. The medians (interquartile ranges) for age were 65 (61-73) years and 48 (36-59) for percent predicted {FEV}1 after bronchodilator use. The mean (95\% confidence interval) percentage emphysema progression was 1.35\% (0.67-2.03) in the losartan group versus 0.66\% (0.09-1.23) in the placebo group (P = {NS}).

	abstract = {Angiotensin {II} ({ANG} {II}), generated by activation of local renin-angiotensin systems, is believed to play an important role in tissue repair and remodeling, in part via transforming growth factor-beta ({TGF}-beta). Angiotensin-converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors have been shown to abrogate experimental lung injury via a number of potential mechanisms; however, the potentially fibroproliferative role for {ANG} {II} in the lung has not been characterized. We hypothesized that, after lung injury, {ANG} {II} would stimulate fibroblast procollagen synthesis and promote lung collagen deposition in rats. In vitro, {ANG} {II} was a potent inducer of procollagen production in human lung fibroblasts via activation of the type 1 receptor and, at least in part, via the autocrine action of {TGF}-beta. After bleomycin-induced lung injury, an increase in lung {ANG} {II} concentration was observed by day 3 that preceded increases in lung collagen and was maintained until death at day 21. Administration of an {ACE} inhibitor (ramipril) reduced {ACE} activity, {ANG} {II} concentration, {TGF}-beta expression, and collagen deposition. Losartan (an {ANG} {II} type 1 receptor antagonist) also attenuated the increase in {TGF}-beta expression and lung collagen deposition. These observations suggest that {ANG} {II}, possibly generated locally within the lung, may play an important role in the fibrotic response to acute lung injury, at least in part via the action of {TGF}-beta. {ACE} inhibitors and receptor antagonists, already widely used clinically, should be assessed as potential new therapies for fibrotic lung disease.},

Recent evidence suggests an association of the renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) with lung inflammation. A study was undertaken to investigate the pathogenic role of the {RAS} in ventilator-induced lung injury ({VILI}) and to determine whether {VILI} can be attenuated by angiotensin converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibition.
{METHODS}: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were mechanically ventilated for 4 h with low (7 ml/kg) or high (40 ml/kg) tidal volumes; non-ventilated rats were used as controls. Lung injury and inflammation were measured by the lung injury score, protein leakage, myeloperoxidase activity, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and nuclear factor ({NF})-{kappaB} activity. Expression of the {RAS} components was also assessed. Some rats were pretreated with the {ACE} inhibitor captopril (10 mg/kg) for 3 days or received a concomitant infusion with losartan or {PD}123319 (type 1 or type 2 angiotensin {II} receptor antagonist) during mechanical ventilation to assess possible protective effects on {VILI}.
{RESULTS}: In the high-volume group (n=6) the lung injury score, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration, pro-inflammatory cytokines and {NF}-{kappaB} activities were significantly increased compared with controls (n=6). Lung tissue angiotensin {II} levels and {mRNA} levels of angiotensinogen and type 1 and type 2 angiotensin {II} receptors were also significantly increased in the high-volume group. Pretreatment with captopril or concomitant infusion with losartan or {PD}123319 in the high-volume group attenuated the lung injury and inflammation (n=6 for each group).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Signalling of angiotensin {II} via angiotensin {II} type 1 receptor ({AT}1) promotes cardiac and renal fibrosis, but its role in lung fibrosis is little understood. Using a rat bleomycin ({BLM}) induced model of pulmonary fibrosis, we examined the expression of {AT}1 in the lung and the effect of an {AT}1 antagonist on pulmonary fibrosis.
{METHODS}: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given 0.3 mg/kg {BLM} intratracheally. Two days earlier they had received 10 mg/kg/day of the {AT}1 antagonist candesartan cilexetil mixed in the drinking water. {AT}1 expression in the lungs was examined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot methods. The effect of the {AT}1 antagonist on pulmonary fibrosis was studied by analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage ({BAL}) fluid, histopathology, and hydroxyproline assay.
{RESULTS}: Immunohistochemical studies showed overexpression of {AT}1 in inflammatory immune cells, alveolar type {II} cells, and fibroblasts. A quantitative assay for {AT}1 showed that {AT}1 expression was significantly upregulated in cells from {BAL} fluid after day 3 and in the lung homogenates after day 21. Candesartan cilexetil significantly inhibited the increase in total protein and albumin, as well as the increase in total cells and neutrophils in {BAL} fluid. On day 21 candesartan cilexetil also ameliorated morphological changes and an increased amount of hydroxyproline in lung homogenates. In addition, {BLM} increased the expression of transforming growth factor ({TGF})-beta1 in {BAL} fluid on day 7; this increase was significantly reduced by candesartan cilexetil.
{CONCLUSION}: {AT}1 expression is upregulated in fibrotic lungs. Angiotensin {II} promotes lung fibrosis via {AT}1 and, presumably, in part via {TGF}-beta1.},

The expression of angiotensin {II} (Ang {II}) {AT}1 and {AT}2 receptors in this setting is not well known and has never been investigated during normoxia recovery. We determined both chronic hypoxia and normoxia recovery patterns of {AT}1 and {AT}2 expression and distal muscularization in the same lungs using in situ binding, reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction, and histology. We also used an isolated perfused lung system to evaluate the vasotonic effects of {AT}1 and {AT}2 during chronic exposure to hypoxia with and without subsequent normoxia recovery. Hypoxia produced right ventricular hypertrophy of about 100\% after 3 wk, which reversed with normoxia recovery. Hypoxia for 2 wk was associated with simultaneous increases (P{\textless}0.05) in {AT}1 and {AT}2 binding (16-fold and 18-fold, respectively) and in muscularized vessels in alveolar ducts (2. 8-fold) and walls (3.7-fold). An increase in {AT}2 messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) (P{\textless}0.05) was also observed, whereas {AT}1 {mRNA} remained unchanged. After 3 wk of hypoxia, muscularization was at its peak, whereas all receptors and transcripts showed decreases (P{\textless}0.05 versus hypoxia 2 wk for {AT}1 {mRNA}), which became significant after 1 wk of normoxia recovery (P{\textless}0.05 versus hypoxia 2 wk). Significant reversal of muscularization (P{\textless}0.01) was found only after 3 wk of normoxia recovery in alveolar wall vessels. Finally, the {AT}1 antagonist losartan completely inhibited the vasopressor effect of Ang {II} in hypoxic and normoxia-restored lungs, whereas the {AT}2 agonist {CGP}42112A had no effect. Our data indicate that in lungs, chronic hypoxia-induced distal muscularization is associated with early and transient increases in {AT}2 and {AT}1 receptors probably owing to hypoxia- dependent transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, respectively. They also indicate that the vasotonic response to Ang {II} is mainly due to the {AT}1 subtype.},

	abstract = {Although angiotensin converting enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors are known to attenuate the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in rats, the precise mechanism of this protective effect remains unknown. Thus we utilized specific angiotensin {II} ({ANG} {II})-receptor antagonists to investigate whether {ANG} {II} is involved directly in the hemodynamic and structural changes of pulmonary hypertension, and we tested whether the protective effects of {ACE} inhibition can be attributed partly to potentiation of bradykinin. During 14 days of hypobaric hypoxia, rats received, via intraperitoneal osmotic minipumps, either 1) the {ACE} inhibitor captopril, 2) captopril plus the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist {CP}-0597, 3) the {ANG} {II} type 1 receptor antagonist losartan, 4) the {ANG} {II} type 2 receptor antagonist {PD}-123319, or 5) saline. At 14 days, mean pulmonary arterial pressure ({MPAP}) was reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) in hypoxic rats treated with captopril (26.6 +/- 0.8 {mmHg}) or losartan (24.4 +/- 1.0 {mmHg}) compared with saline (32.0 +/- 1.4 {mmHg}) but was unaffected by {PD}-123319 (29.5 +/- 1.7 {mmHg}). Right ventricular hypertrophy was reduced in hypoxic rats treated with captopril or losartan compared with saline-treated rats. Morphometry showed less medial thickening and peripheral muscularization of small pulmonary arteries in hypoxic animals treated with captopril or losartan. Coadministration of {CP}-0597 did not reverse the protective effects of captopril on pulmonary vascular remodeling. These results suggest a novel role for endogenous {ANG} {II}, acting through the type 1 receptor, in the vascular remodeling associated with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. The beneficial effects of {ACE} inhibition in this model can be attributed to reduced {ANG} {II} production rather than potentiation of bradykinin.},

	abstract = {In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}), the sympathetic nervous system, as well as the renin-angiotensin system, is activated with possible negative systemic effects on skeletal muscles. Angiotensin {II} type-1 receptor blockers inhibit the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems and might improve skeletal and respiratory muscle strength in patients in whom these systems are activated. The effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker irbesartan given over 4 months was evaluated in 60 patients with {COPD} and a forced expiratory volume in one second of {\textless}50\% of the predicted value and without obvious cardiovascular disease that would necessitate the administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. Irbesartan was well tolerated, but did not exert a significant effect on the primary end-point maximum inspiratory pressure. Spirometric results were not affected, but total lung capacity was reduced. Irbesartan led to a significant decrease in haematocrit (46.4+/-3.6 to 43.9+/-4.3\% versus 47.5+/-2.4 to 48.7+/-3.0\% with placebo). In conclusion, respiratory muscle strength in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients was not influenced by angiotensin {II} receptor blockade. However, the changes in haematocrit and total lung capacity following irbesartan raise the possibility that well-known cardiovascular drugs can produce unanticipated beneficial effects in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A potential association between the use of angiotensin-receptor blockers ({ARBs}) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme ({ACE}) inhibitors and the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has not been well studied.
{METHODS}: We carried out a population-based case-control study in the Lombardy region of Italy. A total of 6272 case patients in whom infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ({SARS}-{CoV}-2) was confirmed between February 21 and March 11, 2020, were matched to 30,759 beneficiaries of the Regional Health Service (controls) according to sex, age, and municipality of residence. Information about the use of selected drugs and patients' clinical profiles was obtained from regional databases of health care use. Odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for associations between drugs and infection, with adjustment for confounders, were estimated by means of logistic regression.
{RESULTS}: Among both case patients and controls, the mean (±{SD}) age was 68±13 years, and 37\% were women. The use of {ACE} inhibitors and {ARBs} was more common among case patients than among controls, as was the use of other antihypertensive and non-antihypertensive drugs, and case patients had a worse clinical profile. Use of {ARBs} or {ACE} inhibitors did not show any association with Covid-19 among case patients overall (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95\% confidence interval \{{CI}\}, 0.86 to 1.05] for {ARBs} and 0.96 [95\% {CI}, 0.87 to 1.07] for {ACE} inhibitors) or among patients who had a severe or fatal course of the disease (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95\% {CI}, 0.63 to 1.10] for {ARBs} and 0.91 [95\% {CI}, 0.69 to 1.21] for {ACE} inhibitors), and no association between these variables was found according to sex.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In this large, population-based study, the use of {ACE} inhibitors and {ARBs} was more frequent among patients with Covid-19 than among controls because of their higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease. However, there was no evidence that {ACE} inhibitors or {ARBs} affected the risk of {COVID}-19.},

	abstract = {{IMPORTANCE}: It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ({ACEIs})/angiotensin receptor blockers ({ARBs}) may make patients more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) and to worse outcomes through upregulation of the functional receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.
{OBJECTIVE}: To examine whether use of {ACEI}/{ARBs} was associated with {COVID}-19 diagnosis and worse outcomes in patients with {COVID}-19.
{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}: To examine outcomes among patients with {COVID}-19, a retrospective cohort study using data from Danish national administrative registries was conducted. Patients with {COVID}-19 from February 22 to May 4, 2020, were identified using {ICD}-10 codes and followed up from day of diagnosis to outcome or end of study period (May 4, 2020). To examine susceptibility to {COVID}-19, a Cox regression model with a nested case-control framework was used to examine the association between use of {ACEI}/{ARBs} vs other antihypertensive drugs and the incidence rate of a {COVID}-19 diagnosis in a cohort of patients with hypertension from February 1 to May 4, 2020.
{EXPOSURES}: {ACEI}/{ARB} use was defined as prescription fillings 6 months prior to the index date.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES}: In the retrospective cohort study, the primary outcome was death, and a secondary outcome was a composite outcome of death or severe {COVID}-19. In the nested case-control susceptibility analysis, the outcome was {COVID}-19 diagnosis.
{RESULTS}: In the retrospective cohort study, 4480 patients with {COVID}-19 were included (median age, 54.7 years [interquartile range, 40.9-72.0]; 47.9\% men). There were 895 users (20.0\%) of {ACEI}/{ARBs} and 3585 nonusers (80.0\%). In the {ACEI}/{ARB} group, 18.1\% died within 30 days vs 7.3\% in the nonuser group, but this association was not significant after adjustment for age, sex, and medical history (adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}], 0.83 [95\% {CI}, 0.67-1.03]). Death or severe {COVID}-19 occurred in 31.9\% of {ACEI}/{ARB} users vs 14.2\% of nonusers by 30 days (adjusted {HR}, 1.04 [95\% {CI}, 0.89-1.23]). In the nested case-control analysis of {COVID}-19 susceptibility, 571 patients with {COVID}-19 and prior hypertension (median age, 73.9 years; 54.3\% men) were compared with 5710 age- and sex-matched controls with prior hypertension but not {COVID}-19. Among those with {COVID}-19, 86.5\% used {ACEI}/{ARBs} vs 85.4\% of controls; {ACEI}/{ARB} use compared with other antihypertensive drugs was not significantly associated with higher incidence of {COVID}-19 (adjusted {HR}, 1.05 [95\% {CI}, 0.80-1.36]).
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE}: Prior use of {ACEI}/{ARBs} was not significantly associated with {COVID}-19 diagnosis among patients with hypertension or with mortality or severe disease among patients diagnosed as having {COVID}-19. These findings do not support discontinuation of {ACEI}/{ARB} medications that are clinically indicated in the context of the {COVID}-19 pandemic.},

In this study, six commercially available {AT}1 receptor antibodies were characterized by established criteria: sc-1173 and sc-579 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., {AAR}-011 from Alomone Labs, Ltd., {AB}15552 from Millipore, and ab18801 and ab9391 from Abcam. The immunostaining patterns observed were different for every antibody tested, and were unrelated to the presence or absence of {AT}1 receptors. The antibodies detected a 43 {kDa} band in western blots, corresponding to the predicted size of the native {AT}1 receptor. However, identical bands were observed in wild-type mice and in {AT}1A knock-out mice not expressing the target protein. Moreover, immunoreactivity detected in rat hypothalamic 4B cells not expressing {AT}1 receptors or transfected with {AT}1A receptor construct was identical, as revealed by western blotting and immunocytochemistry in cultured 4B cells. Additional prominent immunoreactive bands above and below 43 {kDa} were observed by western blotting in extracts from tissues of {AT}1A knock-out and wild-type mice and in 4B cells with or without {AT}1 receptor expression. In all cases, the patterns of immunoreactivity were independent of the {AT}1 receptor expression and different for each antibody studied. We conclude that, in our experimental setup, none of the commercially available {AT}1 receptor antibodies tested met the criteria for specificity and that competitive radioligand binding remains the only reliable approach to study {AT}1 receptor physiology in the absence of full antibody characterization.},

To understand the molecular regulation of the {AT}(1)R in normal physiology and pathophysiology, methods for sensitive and specific detection of {AT}(1)R protein are required. Here, we examined the specificity of a panel of putative {AT}(1)R antibodies that are commonly used by investigators in the field. For these studies, we carried out Western blotting and immunohistochemistry with kidney tissue from wild-type mice and genetically modified mice lacking the major murine {AT}(1)R isoform, {AT}(1A) ({AT}(1A){KO}), or with combined deficiency of both the {AT}(1A) and {AT}(1B) isoforms ({AT}(1AB){KO}). For the 3 antibodies tested, Western blots of protein homogenates from wild-type kidneys yielded distinct bands with the expected size range for {AT}(1)R. In addition, these bands appeared identical in samples from mice lacking 1 or both murine {AT}(1)R isoforms. Additionally, the pattern of immunohistochemical staining in kidneys, liver, and adrenal glands of wild-type mice was very similar to that of {AT}(1AB){KO} mice completely lacking all {AT}(1)R. We verified the absence of {AT}(1)R subtypes in each mouse line by the following: (1) quantitative polymerase chain reaction documenting the absence of {mRNA} species, and (2) functionally by assessing angiotensin {II}-dependent vasoconstriction, which was substantially blunted in both {AT}(1A){KOs} and {AT}(1AB){KOs}. Finally, these antibodies failed to detect epitope-tagged {AT}(1A)R protein overexpressed in human embryonic kidney cells. We conclude that anti-{AT}(1)R antibodies available from commercial sources and commonly used in published studies exhibit nonspecific binding in mouse tissue that may lead to erroneous results.},

Using western blot analysis the immunostaining patterns observed were different for every antibody tested, and in most cases consisted of multiple immunoreactive bands. Identical immunoreactive patterns were present in wild-type and At₂ receptor knockout mice not expressing the target protein. In the mouse brain, immunocytochemical studies revealed very different cellular immunoreactivity for each antibody tested. While the 2818-1 antibody reacted only with endothelial cells in small parenchymal arteries, the sc-9040 antibody reacted only with ependymal cells lining the cerebral ventricles, and the {AAR}-012 antibody reacted only with multiple neuronal cell bodies in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, the immunoreactivities were identical in brain tissue from wild-type or At₂ receptor knockout mice.

This study aimed at characterizing microelastic properties of the ascending aortic wall and lung parenchyma tissues from wild type ({WT}) and age-matched Fbn1 hypomorphic mice (Fbn1({mgR}/{mgR}) mice) to identify tissue-specific biomechanical effects of aging and disease in {MFS}. Atomic force microscopy was used to indent lung parenchyma and aortic wall tissues, using Hybrid Eshelby Decomposition analysis to extract layer-specific properties of the intima and media. The intima stiffened with age and was not different between {WT} and Fbn1({mgR}/{mgR}) tissues, whereas the media layer of {MFS} aortas showed progressive structural and mechanical degradation with a modulus that was 50\% softer than {WT} by 3.5 months of age. Similarly, {MFS} mice displayed progressive structural and mechanical deterioration of lung tissue, which was over 85\% softer than {WT} by 3.5 months of age. Chronic treatment with the angiotensin type I receptor antagonist, losartan, attenuated the aorta and lung tissue degradation, resulting in structural and mechanical properties not significantly different from age-matched {WT} controls. By revealing micromechanical softening of elastin-rich aorta and lung tissues with disease progression in fibrillin-1 deficient mice, our findings support the use of losartan as a prophylactic treatment that may abrogate the life-threatening symptoms of {MFS}.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) is the third leading cause of death globally. Cumulative evidence has implicated renin-angiotensin system ({RAS}) in the pathogenesis of {COPD}. Alveolar macrophages ({AMs}) are the first line immune defense in the respiratory system and play a critical role in the lung homeostasis. This study aimed to investigate the role of {AMs} in contributing to the protective effects of angiotensin {II} type-2 receptor ({AT}2R) activation in cigarette smoke ({CS})-induced {COPD}. The {AM} polarization, phagocytosis and metabolism, and the underlying biochemical mechanisms of compound 21 (C21), a selective and potent non-peptide small molecule {AT}2R agonist, were evaluated in a two-week {CS}-induced {COPD} mouse model. C21 restored {AM} phagocytosis ability, reversing {CS}-induced {AM} phagocytosis impairment. {CS} exposure polarized {AMs} towards M1 phenotype, whereas, C21 skewed the {CS}-exposed {AMs} towards M2 phenotype. C21 reprogrammed {CS}-exposed {AM} metabolism from a high glycolysis-driven process to support inflammation energy demand to a high mitochondrial respiration process to limit inflammation. Besides, C21 upregulated {AT}2R and Mas receptor levels in {CS}-exposed {AMs}, favoring the anti-inflammatory Ang {II}/{AT}2R axis and Ang 1-7/Mas axis in the {RAS}. C21 restored the normal levels of sirtuin 1 ({SIRT}1) and {MAPK} phosphatase 1 ({MKP}1) in {CS}-exposed {AMs}, leading to the reduction of phospho-p38, phospho-{ERK} and p65 subunit of {NF}-κB levels in {CS}-exposed {AMs}. We report here for the first time that {AT}2R agonist C21 acts by boosting the protective functions of {AMs} against {CS}-induced {COPD}, and our results support the development of {AT}2R agonist for the treatment of {COPD}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In addition to regulating blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis, the renin-angiotensin system is also involved in lung fibrogenesis.
{OBJECTIVE}: To study the effect of losartan, an angiotensin {II} antagonist, on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats and its possible mechanism.
{METHODS}: Pulmonary fibrosis was induced in {SD} rats by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (5 mg x kg(-1)). Subsequently, the rats received daily losartan (3, 9 and 27 mg x kg(-1)) or prednisone (20 mg x kg(-1)) orally. Six rats in each group were sacrificed 14 and 21 days after intratracheal instillation. Hydroxyproline, superoxide dismutase ({SOD}), and malondialdehyde ({MDA}) levels in lung tissues were determined by spectroscopy. The levels of {TGF}-beta1 in serum were measured by {ELISA}. Histological changes in the lungs were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin stain, and scored.
{RESULTS}: Rat body weight evidently decreased while the indices of lung and hydroxyproline contents in lung tissue were significantly increased 14 and 21 days after intratracheal bleomycin instillation. Inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrotic scores were more prominent in the model group compared to the sham group. Losartan (3, 9 and 27 mg.kg(-1), i.g.) apparently attenuated the degree of pulmonary fibrosis. Further study showed that losartan significantly increased {SOD} levels while it decreased {MDA} contents in lung homogenates. Serum {TGF}-beta1 levels of pulmonary fibrosis rats were also decreased by losartan.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Losartan had an inhibitory effect on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and its effect may be associated with its anti-free radicals and the reduction in {TGF}-beta1.},

	abstract = {Apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells ({AECs}) has been implicated as a key event in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. Recent studies demonstrated a role for the synthesis and binding of angiotensin {II} to receptor {AT}1 in the induction of {AEC} apoptosis by bleomycin ({BLEO}) and other proapoptotic stimuli. On this basis we hypothesized that {BLEO}-induced apoptosis and lung fibrosis in mice would be inhibited by the {AT}1 antagonist losartan ({LOS}) or by targeted deletion of the {AT}1 gene. Lung fibrosis was induced by intratracheal administration of {BLEO} (1 U/kg) to wild-type C57BL/6J mice. Co-administration of {LOS} abrogated {BLEO}-induced increases in total lung caspase 3 activity detected 6 hours after in vivo administration and reduced by 57\% {BLEO}-induced caspase 3 activity in blood-depleted lung explants exposed to {BLEO} ex vivo (both P {\textless} 0.05). Co-administration of {LOS} in vivo reduced {DNA} fragmentation and immunoreactive caspase 3 (active form) in {AECs}, measured at 14 days after intratracheal {BLEO}, by 66\% and 74\%, respectively (both P {\textless} 0.05). {LOS} also inhibited the accumulation of lung hydroxyproline by 45\%. The same three measures of apoptosis and lung fibrosis were reduced by 89\%, 85\%, and 75\%, respectively (all P {\textless} 0.01), in mice with a targeted disruption of the {AT}1a receptor gene (C57BL/6J-Agtr1a(tm1Unc)). These data indicate an essential role for angiotensin receptor {AT}1a in the pathogenesis of {BLEO}-induced lung fibrosis in mice and suggest that {AT}1 receptor signaling is required for {BLEO}-induced apoptosis of {AECs} in mice as it is in rat and human {AECs}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive interstitial lung disease with no current effective therapies. Treatment has focused on antifibrotic agents to stop proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen deposition in the lung. We present the first clinical trial data on the use of losartan, an antifibrotic agent, to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of losartan on progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis measured by the change in percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (\%{FVC}) after 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the change in forced expiratory volume at 1 second, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, 6-minute walk test distance, and baseline/transition dyspnea index.
{METHODS}: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and a baseline \%{FVC} of ≥50 \% were treated with losartan 50 mg by mouth daily for 12 months. Pulmonary function testing, 6-minute walk, and breathlessness indices were measured every 3 months.
{RESULTS}: Twenty participants with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were enrolled and 17 patients were evaluable for response. Twelve patients had a stable or improved \%{FVC} at study month 12. Similar findings were observed in secondary end-point measures, including 58, 71, and 65 \% of patients with stable or improved forced expiratory volume at 1 second, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, and 6-minute walk test distance, respectively. No treatment-related adverse events that resulted in early study discontinuation were reported.
{CONCLUSION}: Losartan stabilized lung function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis over 12 months. Losartan is a promising agent for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and has a low toxicity profile.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Angiotensin peptides have been implicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ({IPF}) pathogenesis. Angiotensin modulators are used to treat arterial hypertension, a frequent comorbidity of {IPF}. This post hoc analysis evaluated associations of antihypertensive treatments with disease-related outcomes in {IPF}.
{METHODS}: All patients randomized to placebo (n = 624) in the {CAPACITY} and {ASCEND} studies were categorized by antihypertensive treatment at baseline. Outcomes of disease progression (first occurrence of ≥ 10\% absolute decline in \% predicted {FVC}, ≥ 50-m decline in 6-min walk distance, or death) and all-cause mortality were assessed over 52 weeks.
{RESULTS}: At baseline, 111 and 121 patients were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ({ACEi}) or an angiotensin {II} receptor blocker ({ARB}), respectively; 392 were receiving neither. In multivariable analyses adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics compared with the non-{ACEi}/{ARB} group, {ACEi} treatment (hazard ratio [{HR}], 0.6 [95\% {CI}, 0.4-0.9]; P = .026), but not {ARB} ({HR}, 0.9 [95\% {CI}, 0.6-1.2]; P = .413), was associated with slower disease progression. Furthermore, the increase in all-cause mortality associated with cardiovascular disease was not observed in the {ACEi} group ({HR}, 1.1 [95\% {CI}, 0.5-2.9]; P = .782), which presented a similar percentage of {IPF}-related mortality as the non-{ACEi}/{ARB} group (3.6\% vs 3.6\%). In contrast, patients in the {ARB} group had greater risk of all-cause mortality ({HR}, 2.5 [95\% {CI}, 1.2-5.2]). These observations were validated in a pooled analysis that included patients from the {INSPIRE} trial.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Prospective clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether angiotensin modulators may be beneficial to clinical outcomes in {IPF}.

	abstract = {The aim was to determine whether losartan reduces cigarette smoke ({CS})-induced airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion in an in vitro model and a small clinical trial. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells ({HBECs}) were differentiated at the air-liquid interface ({ALI}) and exposed to {CS}. Expression of transforming growth factor ({TGF})-β1 and the mucin {MUC}5AC, and expression or activity of matrix metalloproteinase ({MMP})-9 were measured after {CS} exposure. Parameters of mucociliary clearance were evaluated by measuring airway surface liquid volumes, mucus concentrations, and conductance of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) and large conductance, Ca2+-activated and voltage-dependent potassium ({BK}) channels. Nasal cells were collected from study participants and expression of {MUC}5AC, {TGF}-β1, and {MMP}-9 {mRNAs} was measured before and after losartan treatment. In vitro, {CS} exposure of {HBECs} caused a significant increase in {mRNA} expression of {MUC}5AC and {TGF}-β1 and {MMP}-9 activity and decreased {CFTR} and {BK} channel activities, thereby reducing airway surface liquid volumes and increasing mucus concentrations. Treatment of {HBECs} with losartan rescued {CS}-induced {CFTR} and {BK} dysfunction and caused a significant decrease in {MUC}5AC expression and mucus concentrations, partially by inhibiting {TGF}-β signalling. In a prospective clinical study, cigarette smokers showed significantly reduced {mRNA} expression levels of {MUC}5AC, {TGF}-β1, and {MMP}-9 in the upper airways after 2 months of losartan treatment. Our findings suggest that losartan may be an effective therapy to reduce inflammation and mucus hypersecretion in {CS}-induced chronic airway diseases.},

Integrating many single-cell datasets can address these limitations of individual studies and capture the variability present in the population. Here we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas ({HLCA}), combining 49 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.4 million cells from 486 individuals. The {HLCA} presents a consensus cell type re-annotation with matching marker genes, including annotations of rare and previously undescribed cell types. Leveraging the number and diversity of individuals in the {HLCA}, we identify gene modules that are associated with demographic covariates such as age, sex and body mass index, as well as gene modules changing expression along the proximal-to-distal axis of the bronchial tree. Mapping new data to the {HLCA} enables rapid data annotation and interpretation. Using the {HLCA} as a reference for the study of disease, we identify shared cell states across multiple lung diseases, including {SPP}1+ profibrotic monocyte-derived macrophages in {COVID}-19, pulmonary fibrosis and lung carcinoma. Overall, the {HLCA} serves as an example for the development and use of large-scale, cross-dataset organ atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.},

Several neutrophil (adherence, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, superoxide anion stimulated production) and lymphocyte (adherence, chemotaxis, lymphoproliferation, natural killer activity) functions, cytokine concentrations released in response to lipopolysaccharide (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin ({IL})-6, {IL}-8, {IL}-10) and redox parameters (intracellular glutathione content, basal superoxide anion level) were assessed in circulating leukocytes of men with moderate and severe stages of {COPD}, and compared to healthy age-matched volunteers. The biological age or aging rate in each participant was determined using the values of leukocyte functions. The results indicated impairment of immune functions in {COPD} patients, both in innate and adaptive immunity, and higher pro-inflammatory and oxidative states in peripheral leukocytes than controls. In general, these changes were more remarkable at the severe stage of airway obstruction. Importantly, {COPD} patients were found to be aging at a faster rate than age-matched healthy counterparts.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To compare whites and African-Americans in terms of dementia risk following index stroke.
{METHODS}: The data consisted of billing and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes from the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs office on all hospital discharges within the state between 2000 and 2012. The sample consisted of 68,758 individuals with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke prior to 2010 (49,262 white [71.65\%] and 19,496 African-Americans [28.35\%]). We identified individuals in the dataset who were subsequently diagnosed with any of 5 categories of dementia and evaluated time to dementia diagnosis in Cox Proportional Hazards models. We plotted cumulative hazard curves to illustrate the effect of race on dementia risk after controlling for age, sex, and occurrence of intervening stroke.
{RESULTS}: Age at index stroke was significantly different between the 2 groups, with African-Americans being younger on average (70.0 [{SD} 12.5] in whites versus 64.5 [{SD} 14.1] in African-Americans, P {\textless} .0001). Adjusted hazard ratios revealed that African-American race increased risk for all 5 categories of dementia following incident stroke, ranging from 1.37 for {AD} to 1.95 for vascular dementia. Age, female sex, and intervening stroke likewise increased risk for dementia.
{CONCLUSIONS}: African-Americans are at higher risk for dementia than whites within 5 years of ischemic stroke, regardless of dementia subtype. Incident strokes may have a greater likelihood of precipitating dementia in African-Americans due to higher prevalence of nonstroke cerebrovascular disease or other metabolic or vascular factors that contribute to cognitive impairment.},

Although our understanding of the genetic architecture of molecular and complex traits has been maturing, a large proportion of complex trait heritability remains unexplained. Furthermore, there are increasing efforts to characterize the effect of environmental exposure on human health.

	abstract = {Short tandem repeats ({STRs}) are highly polymorphic sequences throughout the human genome that are composed of repeated copies of a 1–6-bp motif. Over 1 million variable {STR} loci are known, some of which regulate gene expression and influence complex traits, such as height. Moreover, variants in at least 60 {STR} loci cause genetic disorders, including Huntington disease and fragile X syndrome. Accurately identifying and genotyping {STR} variants is challenging, in particular mapping short reads to repetitive regions and inferring expanded repeat lengths. Recent advances in sequencing technology and computational tools for {STR} genotyping from sequencing data promise to help overcome this challenge and solve genetically unresolved cases and the ‘missing heritability’ of polygenic traits. Here, we compare {STR} genotyping methods, analytical tools and their applications to understand the effect of {STR} variation on health and disease. We identify emergent opportunities to refine genotyping and quality-control approaches as well as to integrate {STRs} into variant-calling workflows and large cohort analyses.},

We describe the cohort, present cognitive trajectories and show the potential utility. Surprisingly, when studied at scale, the {APOE} genotype had negligible impact on cognitive performance. Different cognitive domains had distinct genetic architectures, with one indicating brain region-specific activation of microglia and another with glycogen metabolism. Thus, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning cognition are distinct from dementia risk loci, presenting different targets to slow down age-related cognitive decline.

However, individuals who display the same global ancestry could exhibit remarkable differences in the distribution of local ancestry blocks. We studied for the first time the distribution of local ancestry across the genome of 264 Brazilian admixed individuals, ascertained within the scope of the Brazilian Initiative on Precision Medicine. We found a decreased proportion of European ancestry together with an excess of Native-American ancestry on chromosome 8p23.1 and showed that this is due to haplotypes created by chromosomal inversion events. Furthermore, Brazilian non-inverted haplotypes were more similar to Native-American haplotypes than to European haplotypes, in contrast to what was found in other American admixed populations. We also identified signals of recent positive selection on chromosome 8p23.1, and one gene within this locus, {PPP}1R3B, is related to glycogenesis and has been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity. These findings point to a selection event after admixture, which is still not entirely understood in recent admixture events.},

Results from {TWAS} analyses are often interpreted as indicating a genetic relationship between gene expression and a phenotype, but this interpretation is not consistent with the null hypothesis that is evaluated in the traditional {TWAS} framework. In this study we provide a mathematical outline of this {TWAS} framework, and elucidate what interpretations are warranted given the null hypothesis it actually tests. We then use both simulations and real data analysis to assess the implications of misinterpreting {TWAS} results as indicative of a genetic relationship between gene expression and the phenotype. Our simulation results show considerably inflated type 1 error rates for {TWAS} when interpreted this way, with 41\% of significant {TWAS} associations detected in the real data analysis found to have insufficient statistical evidence to infer such a relationship. This demonstrates that in current implementations, {TWAS} cannot reliably be used to investigate genetic relationships between gene expression and a phenotype, but that local genetic correlation analysis can serve as a potential alternative.},

	abstract = {Compared with any other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ({OECD}), the United States spends more money on health care and still has the highest poverty rate measured by the {OECD}, the greatest income inequality, and some of the poorest health outcomes among developed countries (Escarce, 2019). For a variety of reasons, low-income individuals, people of color ({POC}), and residents of rural areas in the United States experience a significantly greater burden of disease and lower life expectancy relative to their higher income, White, and urban counterparts, and this gap has been growing over time (Escarce, 2019). The roots of these inequities are deep and complex, and understanding them can help elucidate how nurses who currently serve a highly diverse population play a pivotal role in addressing social determinants of health ({SDOH})—the conditions in the environments in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks—to improve health outcomes and reduce health inequities. To further that understanding, this chapter provides background on {SDOH} and highlights social factors that disproportionately affect some communities more than others; Chapters 4 and 5, respectively, describe the role of nurses in addressing these inequities in health and health care. This chapter also describes the impact of the {COVID}-19 pandemic in exacerbating the negative effects of {SDOH} and health inequities among low-income communities and {POC} (Garcia et al., 2020; Kantamneni, 2020).},

	abstract = {Admixture is a common biological phenomenon among populations of the same or different species. Identifying admixed tracts within individual genomes can provide valuable information to date admixture events, reconstruct ancestry-specific demographic histories, or detect adaptive introgression, genetic incompatibilities, as well as regions of the genomes affected by (associative-) overdominance. Although many local ancestry inference ({LAI}) methods have been developed in the last decade, their performance was accessed using large reference panels, which are rarely available for non-model organisms or ancient samples. Moreover, the demographic conditions for which {LAI} becomes unreliable have not been explicitly outlined. Here, we identify the demographic conditions for which local ancestries can be best estimated using very small reference panels. Furthermore, we compare the performance of two {LAI} methods ({RFMix} and {MOSAIC}) with the performance of a newly developed approach ({simpLAI}) that can be used even when reference populations consist of single individuals. Based on simulations of various demographic models, we also determine the limits of these {LAI} tools and propose post-painting filtering steps to reduce false-positive rates and improve the precision and accuracy of the inferred admixed tracts. Besides providing a guide for using {LAI}, our work shows that reasonable inferences can be obtained from a single diploid genome per reference under demographic conditions that are not uncommon among past human groups and non-model organisms.},

	abstract = {Local ancestry estimation infers the regional ancestral origin of chromosomal segments in admixed populations using reference populations and a variety of statistical models. Integrating local ancestry into complex trait genetics has the potential to increase detection of genetic associations and improve genetic prediction models in understudied admixed populations, including African Americans and Hispanics. Five methods for local ancestry estimation that have been used in human complex trait genetics are {LAMP}-{LD} (2012), {RFMix} (2013), {ELAI} (2014), Loter (2018), and {MOSAIC} (2019). As users rather than developers, we sought to perform direct comparisons of accuracy, runtime, memory usage, and usability of these software tools to determine which is best for incorporation into association study pipelines. We find that in the majority of cases {RFMix} has the highest median accuracy with the ranking of the remaining software dependent on the ancestral architecture of the population tested. Additionally, we estimate the O(n) of both memory and runtime for each software and find that for both time and memory most software increase linearly with respect to sample size. The only exception is {RFMix}, which increases quadratically with respect to runtime and linearly with respect to memory. Effective local ancestry estimation tools are necessary to increase diversity and prevent population disparities in human genetics studies. {RFMix} performs the best across methods, however, depending on application, other methods perform just as well with the benefit of shorter runtimes. Scripts used to format data, run software, and estimate accuracy can be found at https://github.com/{WheelerLab}/{LAI}\_benchmarking.},

	abstract = {Background Understanding genetic underpinnings of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases is crucial to improve treatments. Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) identifies cell states expanded in disease, but often overlooks genetic causality due to cost and small genotyping cohorts. Conversely, large genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) are commonly accessible.
Methods We present a 3-step robust benchmarking analysis of integrating {GWAS} and {scRNA}-seq to identify genetically relevant cell states and genes in inflammatory diseases. First, we applied and compared the results of two recent algorithms, based on networks ({scGWAS}) or single-cell disease scores ({scDRS}), according to accuracy/sensitivity and interpretability (M. J. Zhang et al. 2022; Jia et al. 2022). While previous studies focused on coarse cell types, we used disease-specific, fine-grained single-cell atlases (183,742 and 228,211 cells) and {GWAS} data (Ns of 97,1,73 and 45,975) for rheumatoid arthritis ({RA}) and ulcerative colitis ({UC}) (F. Zhang et al. 2023; Ishigaki et al. 2022; Smillie et al. 2019; de Lange et al. 2017). Second, given the lack of {scRNA}-seq for many diseases with {GWAS}, we further tested the tools’ resolution limits by differentiating between similar diseases with only one fine-grained {scRNA}-seq atlas. Lastly, we provide a novel evaluation of noncoding {SNP} incorporation methods by testing which enabled the highest sensitivity/accuracy of known cell-state calls.
Results We first found that single-cell based tool {scDRS} called superior numbers of supported cell states, like {MERTK}+ myeloid cells in {RA}, which were overlooked by network-based {scGWAS}. While {scGWAS} was advantageous for gene exploration, {scDRS} captured cellular heterogeneity of disease-relevance without single-cell genotyping. For noncoding {SNP} integration, we found a key trade-off between statistical power and confidence with positional (e.g. {MAGMA}) and non-positional approaches (e.g. chromatin-interaction, {eQTL}). Even when directly incorporating noncoding {SNPs} through 5’ {scRNA}-seq measures of regulatory elements, non disease-specific atlases gave misleading results by not containing disease-tissue specific transcriptomic patterns. Despite this criticality of tissue-specific {scRNA}-seq, we showed that {scDRS} enabled deconvolution of two similar diseases with a single fine-grained {scRNA}-seq atlas and separate {GWAS}. Indeed, we identified supported and novel genetic-phenotype linkages separating {RA} and ankylosing spondylitis, and {UC} and crohn’s disease. Overall, while noting evolving single-cell technologies, our study provides key findings for integrating expanding fine-grained {scRNA}-seq, {GWAS}, and noncoding {SNP} resources to unravel the complexities of inflammatory diseases.},

The evolutionary genetic dissection of the immune system has greatly helped to distinguish genes and functions that are essential, redundant or advantageous for human survival. It is also becoming increasingly clear that admixture between early Eurasians with now-extinct hominins such as Neanderthals or Denisovans, or admixture between modern human populations, can be beneficial for human adaptation to pathogen pressures. In this review, we discuss how the integration of population genetics with functional genomics in diverse human populations can inform about the changes in immune functions related to major lifestyle transitions (e.g., from hunting and gathering to farming), the action of natural selection to the evolution of the immune system, and the history of past epidemics. We also highlight the need of expanding the characterization of the immune system to a larger array of human populations-particularly neglected human groups historically exposed to different pathogen pressures-to fully capture the relative contribution of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors to immune response variation in humans.},

Despite this widespread interest, specific localization of this receptor family in the mammalian lung is limited, partially due to the imprecision of available antibody reagents. In this study, we establish the expression pattern of the two predominant angiotensin receptors in the human lung, {AGTR}1 and {AGTR}2, using complementary and comprehensive bulk and single-cell {RNA}-sequence datasets that are publicly available. We show these two receptors have distinct localization patterns and developmental trajectories in the human lung, pericytes for {AGTR}1 and a subtype of alveolar epithelial type 2 cells for {AGTR}2. In the context of disease, we further pinpoint {AGTR}2 localization to the {COPD}-associated subpopulation of alveolar epithelial type 2 ({AT}2B) and {AGTR}1 localization to fibroblasts, where their expression is upregulated in individuals with {COPD}, but not in individuals with {IPF}. Finally, we examine the genetic variation of the angiotensin receptors, finding {AGTR}2 associated with lung phenotype (i.e., cystic fibrosis) via rs1403543. Together, our findings provide a critical foundation for delineating this pathway’s role in lung homeostasis and constructing rational approaches for targeting specific lung disorders.},

Using summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program ({MVP}), we showed that {GRSs} derived from data of African American individuals enhance polygenic prediction of lipid traits in {SSA} compared to European and multiancestry scores. However, our {GRS} prediction varied greatly within {SSA} between the South African Zulu (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ({LDL}-C), R2 = 8.14\%) and Ugandan cohorts ({LDL}-C, R2 = 0.026\%).

Structural racism captures upstream historic racist events (such as slavery, black code, and Jim Crow laws) and more recent state-sanctioned racist laws in the form of redlining. Redlining refers to the practice of systematically denying various services (e.g., credit access) to residents of specific neighborhoods, often based on race/ethnicity and primarily within urban communities. Historical redlining is linked to increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, and early mortality due to heart disease with evidence suggesting it impacts health through suppressing economic opportunity and human capital, or the knowledge, skills, and value one contributes to society. Addressing structural racism has been a rallying call for change in recent years—drawing attention to the racialized impact of historical policies in the {USA}. Unfortunately, the enormous scope of work has also left people feeling incapable of effecting the very change they seek. This paper highlights a path forward by briefly discussing the origins of historical redlining, highlighting the modern-day consequences both on health and at the societal level, and suggest promising initiatives to address the impact.},

In this study, we introduce {GRN} inference with Accuracy and Causal Explanation ({GRACE}), a novel graph-based causal autoencoder framework that combines a structural causal model ({SCM}) with graph neural networks ({GNNs}) to enable {GRN} inference and gene causal reasoning from {scRNA}-seq data. By explicitly modeling causal relationships between genes, {GRACE} facilitates the learning of regulatory context and gene embeddings. With the learned gene signals, our model successfully decoding the causal structures and alleviates the accurate determination of multiple attributes of gene regulation that is important to determine the regulatory levels. Through extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks, we demonstrate that {GRACE} outperforms 14 state-of-the-art {GRN} inference methods, with the incorporation of causal mechanisms significantly enhancing the accuracy of {GRN} and gene causality inference. Furthermore, the application to human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ({PBMC}) samples reveals cell type-specific regulators in monocyte phagocytosis and immune regulation, validated through network analysis and functional enrichment analysis.},

Here, we performed single-cell dissection of schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic changes in the human prefrontal cortex across 140 individuals in two independent cohorts. Excitatory neurons were the most affected cell group, with transcriptional changes converging on neurodevelopment and synapse-related molecular pathways. Transcriptional alterations included known genetic risk factors, suggesting convergence of rare and common genomic variants on neuronal population-specific alterations in schizophrenia. Based on the magnitude of schizophrenia-associated transcriptional change, we identified two populations of individuals with schizophrenia marked by expression of specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal cell states.

              {INTRODUCTION}
              Schizophrenia population genomics has identified strong germline genetic associations for this highly heritable disorder, and molecular investigation of postmortem brain samples has yielded evidence of transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations associated with this disease. However, identifying molecular and cellular pathophysiological processes linking etiological risk factors and clinical presentation remains a challenge, due in part to the complex cellular architecture of the brain.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              Past work has implicated specific populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, but existing large transcriptomic datasets of bulk tissue samples cannot directly assess cell type–specific contributions to disease. Single-cell {RNA} sequencing technologies allow measurement of genome-wide gene expression in individual cells with high-throughput, moving beyond bulk tissue measures to map disease-associated transcriptional changes in discrete cellular populations without bias toward preselected cell types. Investigating disease-associated phenotypic changes across the myriad cellular populations of the human brain can produce new insights into neuropsychiatric disease biology.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              Using multiplexed single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing, we developed a single-cell resolution transcriptomic atlas of the prefrontal cortex across subjects with and without schizophrenia and present data from 468,727 nuclei isolated from 140 individuals across two well-defined and independently assayed cohorts. We identified expression profiles of brain cell types and neuronal subpopulations and systematically characterized the transcriptional changes associated with schizophrenia in each. For completeness, we report independent, cohort-specific analyses and joint meta-analysis of differential expression across 25 cell types. Using these data, we identified highly cell type–specific and reproducible expression changes, with 6634 differential expression events affecting 2455 genes and favoring down-regulated gene expression within excitatory neuronal populations. We found significant overlap with previously reported bulk cortex expression changes, primarily for excitatory neuronal populations, whereas changes in lower-abundance cell types were less efficiently captured in tissue-level profiling. Differentially expressed genes enrich neurodevelopmental and synapse-related molecular pathways and point to a regulatory core of coexpressed transcription factors linked to genetic risk variants for schizophrenia and developmental delay. Transcription factor targeting of schizophrenia differentially expressed genes in neuronal populations was validated with {CUT}\&Tag in neuronal nuclei isolated from human prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, both transcriptional changes and putative upstream regulatory factors were enriched with genes harboring common and rare risk variants for schizophrenia, presenting evidence that genetic risk variants across the population frequency spectrum tend to target genes with measurable expression alterations in the excitatory neurons of patients with schizophrenia. Finally, the magnitude of schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic change segregated two populations of schizophrenia subjects. Transcriptomic heterogeneity within the cohorts was associated with specific cellular states shared across multiple neuronal populations, marked by genes related to synaptic function and one-carbon metabolism, suggesting genes characterizing distinct molecular phenotypes of schizophrenia.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              Our results provide a valuable resource to investigate the molecular pathophysiology of schizophrenia at single-cell resolution, offering insights into preferential dysregulation of specific neuronal populations and their potential role in mediating genetic risk. Together, they suggest convergence of etiological genetic risk factors, neuronal transcriptional dysregulation, and symptomatic manifestation in schizophrenia.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Recent advances in generating massive single-cell/nucleus transcriptomic data have shown great potential for facilitating the identification of cell type-specific Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) pathobiology and drug-target discovery for therapeutic development.
{METHODS}: We developed The Alzheimer's Cell Atlas ({TACA}) by compiling an {AD} brain cell atlas consisting of over 1.1 million cells/nuclei across 26 data sets, covering major brain regions (hippocampus, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, and so on) and cell types (astrocyte, microglia, neuron, oligodendrocytes, and so on). We conducted nearly 1400 differential expression comparisons to identify cell type-specific molecular alterations (e.g., case vs healthy control, sex-specific, apolipoprotein E ({APOE}) ε4/ε4, and {TREM}2 mutations). Each comparison was followed by protein-protein interaction module detection, functional enrichment analysis, and omics-informed target and drug (over 700,000 perturbation profiles) screening. Over 400 cell-cell interaction analyses using 6000 ligand-receptor interactions were conducted to identify the cell-cell communication networks in {AD}.
{RESULTS}: All results are integrated into {TACA} (https://taca.lerner.ccf.org/), a new web portal with cell type-specific, abundant transcriptomic information, and 12 interactive visualization tools for {AD}.
{DISCUSSION}: We envision that {TACA} will be a highly valuable resource for both basic and translational research in {AD}, as it provides abundant information for {AD} pathobiology and actionable systems biology tools for drug discovery.
{HIGHLIGHTS}: We compiled an Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) brain cell atlas consisting of more than 1.1 million cells/nuclei transcriptomes from 26 data sets, covering major brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and cell types (e.g., neuron, oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, and microglia).We conducted over 1400 differential expression ({DE}) comparisons to identify cell type-specific gene expression alterations. Major comparison types are (1) {AD} versus healthy control; (2) sex-specific {DE}, (3) genotype-driven {DE} (i.e., apolipoprotein E [{APOE}] ε4/ε4 vs {APOE} ε3/ε3; {TREM}2R47H vs common variants) analysis; and (4) others. Each comparison was further followed by (1) human protein-protein interactome network module analysis, (2) pathway enrichment analysis, and (3) gene-set enrichment analysis.For drug screening, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis for all the comparisons with over 700,000 drug perturbation profiles connecting more than 10,000 human genes and 13,000 drugs/compounds.A total of over 400 analyses of cell-cell interactions against 6000 experimentally validated ligand-receptor interactions were conducted to reveal the disease-relevant cell-cell communications in {AD}.},

              Alzheimer’s Disease ({AD}) pathology has been increasingly explored through single-cell and single-nucleus {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq \& {snRNA}-seq) and spatial transcriptomics ({ST}). However, the surge in data demands a comprehensive, user-friendly repository. Addressing this, we introduce a single-cell and spatial {RNA}-seq database for Alzheimer’s disease ({ssREAD}). It offers a broader spectrum of {AD}-related datasets, an optimized analytical pipeline, and improved usability. The database encompasses 1,053 samples (277 integrated datasets) from 67 {AD}-related {scRNA}-seq \& {snRNA}-seq studies, totaling 7,332,202 cells. Additionally, it archives 381 {ST} datasets from 18 human and mouse brain studies. Each dataset is annotated with details such as species, gender, brain region, disease/control status, age, and {AD} Braak stages. {ssREAD} also provides an analysis suite for cell clustering, identification of differentially expressed and spatially variable genes, cell-type-specific marker genes and regulons, and spot deconvolution for integrative analysis. {ssREAD} is freely available at

              {INTRODUCTION}
              The cortical layers of the human neocortex were classically defined by histological distinction of cell types according to size, shape, and density. However, emerging single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies have facilitated the identification of molecularly defined cell populations and spatial domains that move beyond classic cell type definitions and cytoarchitectural boundaries.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              Given the close relationship between brain structure and function, assigning gene expression to distinct anatomical subdivisions and cell populations within the human brain improves our understanding of these highly specialized regions and how they contribute to brain disorders. We sought to create a data-driven molecular neuroanatomical map of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) at cellular resolution using unsupervised transcriptomic approaches to identify spatial domains associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              We generated complementary single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data from 10 adult, neurotypical control donors across the anterior-posterior axis of the {DLPFC}. Unsupervised spatial clustering revealed fine-resolution data-driven spatial domains with distinct molecular signatures, including deep cortical sublayers and a vasculature-enriched meninges layer. Cell type clustering of single-nucleus {RNA}-sequencing ({snRNA}-seq) data revealed 29 distinct populations across seven broad neuronal and glial cell types, including 15 excitatory subpopulations. To add cellular resolution to our data-driven molecular atlas, we took two complementary approaches to integrate single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. First, we used our previously developed spatial registration framework to map the paired {snRNA}-seq data to specific unsupervised spatial domains, providing anatomy-based laminar identities to excitatory neuron subpopulations. Second, we used three existing spot-level deconvolution tools to computationally predict the cell type composition of spatial domains on the basis of the paired {snRNA}-seq reference data. These tools were rigorously benchmarked against a newly generated gold-standard reference dataset acquired with the Visium Spatial Proteogenomics assay, which enabled us to label and quantify four broad cell types across the {DLPFC} on the basis of protein marker expression, including neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Using these approaches, we identified the proportion of cell types in each spatial domain and showed that these proportions were consistent across individuals and the {DLPFC} anterior-posterior axis. We demonstrated the clinical relevance of our highly integrated molecular atlas using cell-cell communication analyses to spatially map cell type–specific ligand-receptor interactions associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia ({SCZ}). For example, we mapped the interaction between ephrin ligand {EFNA}5 and ephrin receptor {EPHA}5 to deep-layer excitatory neuron subtypes and spatial domains. To leverage the rich single-cell data generated by {PsychENCODE} Consortium companion studies, we spatially registered eight {DLPFC} {snRNA}-seq datasets collected across the consortium in the context of different neuropsychiatric disorders and demonstrated a convergence of excitatory, inhibitory, and non-neuronal cell types in relevant spatial domains. Using {PsychENCODE} Consortium and other publicly available gene sets, we further demonstrated the clinical relevance of our data-driven molecular atlas by mapping the enrichment of cell types and genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders—including autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder—to discrete spatial domains.
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              Our study identified high-resolution, data-driven spatial domains across the human {DLPFC}, providing anatomical context for cell type–specific gene expression changes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric illness. We provide a roadmap for the implementation and biological validation of unsupervised spatial clustering approaches in other regions of the human brain. We share interactive data resources for the scientific community to further interrogate molecular mechanisms associated with complex brain disorders.

We use {tDISCO} alongside two high-throughput platforms for spatial (Visium) and single-cell transcriptomics (10X Chromium) to examine the heterogeneity of the astrocyte response to a cortical ischemic stroke in male mice. We show that integration of Visium and 10X Chromium datasets infers two astrocyte populations, proximal or distal to the injury site, while {tDISCO} determines the spatial boundaries and molecular profiles that define these populations. We find that proximal astrocytes show differences in lipid shuttling, with enriched expression of Apoe and Fabp5.

              The mammalian brain consists of millions to billions of cells that are organized into many cell types with specific spatial distribution patterns and structural and functional properties
              1–3
              . Here we report a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas for the whole adult mouse brain. The cell-type atlas was created by combining a single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) dataset of around 7 million cells profiled (approximately 4.0 million cells passing quality control), and a spatial transcriptomic dataset of approximately 4.3 million cells using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization ({MERFISH}). The atlas is hierarchically organized into 4 nested levels of classification: 34 classes, 338 subclasses, 1,201 supertypes and 5,322 clusters. We present an online platform, Allen Brain Cell Atlas, to visualize the mouse whole-brain cell-type atlas along with the single-cell {RNA}-sequencing and {MERFISH} datasets. We systematically analysed the neuronal and non-neuronal cell types across the brain and identified a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type. The results reveal unique features of cell-type organization in different brain regions—in particular, a dichotomy between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain. The dorsal part contains relatively fewer yet highly divergent neuronal types, whereas the ventral part contains more numerous neuronal types that are more closely related to each other. Our study also uncovered extraordinary diversity and heterogeneity in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and co-expression patterns in different cell types. Finally, we found that transcription factors are major determinants of cell-type classification and identified a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines cell types across all parts of the brain. The whole mouse brain transcriptomic and spatial cell-type atlas establishes a benchmark reference atlas and a foundational resource for integrative investigations of cellular and circuit function, development and evolution of the mammalian brain.},

            Charting an organs’ biological atlas requires us to spatially resolve the entire single-cell transcriptome, and to relate such cellular features to the anatomical scale. Single-cell and single-nucleus {RNA}-seq (sc/{snRNA}-seq) can profile cells comprehensively, but lose spatial information. Spatial transcriptomics allows for spatial measurements, but at lower resolution and with limited sensitivity. Targeted in situ technologies solve both issues, but are limited in gene throughput. To overcome these limitations we present Tangram, a method that aligns sc/{snRNA}-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same region, including {MERFISH}, {STARmap}, {smFISH}, Spatial Transcriptomics (Visium) and histological images. Tangram can map any type of sc/{snRNA}-seq data, including multimodal data such as those from {SHARE}-seq, which we used to reveal spatial patterns of chromatin accessibility. We demonstrate Tangram on healthy mouse brain tissue, by reconstructing a genome-wide anatomically integrated spatial map at single-cell resolution of the visual and somatomotor areas.},

We used paired whole genome sequencing and gene expression from 839 individuals in the {ROSMAP} study7 to evaluate the ability of current methods to predict gene expression variation across individuals at varied loci.

            Many methods have been developed to leverage expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) data to nominate candidate genes from genome-wide association studies. These methods, including colocalization, transcriptome-wide association studies ({TWAS}) and Mendelian randomization-based methods; however, all suffer from a key problem—when assessing the role of a gene in a trait using its {eQTLs}, nearby variants and genetic components of other genes’ expression may be correlated with these {eQTLs} and have direct effects on the trait, acting as potential confounders. Our extensive simulations showed that existing methods fail to account for these ‘genetic confounders’, resulting in severe inflation of false positives. Our new method, causal-{TWAS} ({cTWAS}), borrows ideas from statistical fine-mapping and allows us to adjust all genetic confounders. {cTWAS} showed calibrated false discovery rates in simulations, and its application on several common traits discovered new candidate genes. In conclusion, {cTWAS} provides a robust statistical framework for gene discovery.},

Here we present {SuSiEx}, an accurate and computationally efficient method for cross-population fine-mapping. {SuSiEx} integrates data from an arbitrary number of ancestries, explicitly models population-specific allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns, accounts for multiple causal variants in a genomic region and can be applied to {GWAS} summary statistics. We comprehensively assessed the performance of {SuSiEx} using simulations. We further showed that {SuSiEx} improves the fine-mapping of a range of quantitative traits available in both the {UK} Biobank and Taiwan Biobank, and improves the fine-mapping of schizophrenia-associated loci by integrating {GWAS} across East Asian and European ancestries.},

Microglia and astrocytes, the two major immune cells in the brain, exist in an immune-vigilant state providing immunological defense as well as housekeeping functions that promote neuronal well-being. It is becoming increasingly evident that under disease conditions, these immune cells become progressively dysfunctional in regulating metabolic and immunoregulatory pathways, thereby promoting chronic inflammation-induced neurodegeneration.

We investigated the interaction between African ancestry, {AD}-related neuropathology, {APOE} genotype, and functional cognition in a postmortem sample of 400 individuals with a range of {AD} pathology severity and lack of comorbid neuropathology from a cohort of community-dwelling, admixed Brazilians.

We characterize some of the empirical properties of the {eQTL} data and use this framework to assess the current state of {eQTL} data in terms of characterizing cis-regulatory landscape in individual genomes. Notably, we show that 77.4\% of the genes with an allelic imbalance in a sample show 0.5 log2 fold or more of residual imbalance after accounting for the {eQTL} data underlining the remaining gap in characterizing regulatory landscape in individual genomes.

However, the methodological impact of the use of local ancestry on high-dimensional omics analyses, including, most prominently, expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) mapping and trait heritability estimation, in admixed populations remains critically underexplored. Here, we develop a statistical framework that characterizes the relationships among the determinants of the genetic architecture of an important class of molecular traits. We provide a computationally efficient approach to local ancestry analysis in {eQTL} mapping while increasing control of type I and type {II} error over traditional approaches. Applying our method to National Institute of General Medical Sciences ({NIGMS}) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) datasets, we show that the use of local ancestry can improve {eQTL} mapping in admixed and multiethnic populations, respectively. We estimate the trait variance explained by ancestry by using local admixture relatedness between individuals. By using simulations of diverse genetic architectures and degrees of confounding, we show improved accuracy in estimating heritability when accounting for local ancestry similarity. Furthermore, we characterize the sparse versus polygenic components of gene expression in admixed individuals. Our study has important methodological implications for genetic analysis of omics traits across a range of genomic contexts, from a single variant to a prioritized region to the entire genome. Our findings highlight the importance of using local ancestry to better characterize the heritability of complex traits and to more accurately map genetic associations.},

	abstract = {Substance use disorders ({SUD}) and drug addiction are major threats to public health, impacting not only the millions of individuals struggling with {SUD}, but also surrounding families and communities. One of the seminal challenges in treating and studying addiction in human populations is the high prevalence of co-morbid conditions, including an increased risk of contracting a human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) infection. Of the {\textasciitilde}15 million people who inject drugs globally, 17\% are persons with {HIV}. Conversely, {HIV} is a risk factor for {SUD} because chronic pain syndromes, often encountered in persons with {HIV}, can lead to an increased use of opioid pain medications that in turn can increase the risk for opioid addiction. We hypothesize that {SUD} and {HIV} exert shared effects on brain cell types, including adaptations related to neuroplasticity, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Basic research is needed to refine our understanding of these affected cell types and adaptations. Studying the effects of {SUD} in the context of {HIV} at the single-cell level represents a compelling strategy to understand the reciprocal interactions among both conditions, made feasible by the availability of large, extensively-phenotyped human brain tissue collections that have been amassed by the Neuro-{HIV} research community. In addition, sophisticated animal models that have been developed for both conditions provide a means to precisely evaluate specific exposures and stages of disease. We propose that single-cell genomics is a uniquely powerful technology to characterize the effects of {SUD} and {HIV} in the brain, integrating data from human cohorts and animal models. We have formed the Single-Cell Opioid Responses in the Context of {HIV} ({SCORCH}) consortium to carry out this strategy.},

We compare the dimensions learned in this source dataset to adult mouse retina, a time-course of human retinal development, select {scRNA}-seq datasets from developing brain, chromatin accessibility data, and a murine-cell type atlas to identify shared biological features.

	abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization ({NMF}) is an unsupervised learning method well suited to high-throughput biology. However, inferring biological processes from an {NMF} result still requires additional post hoc statistics and annotation for interpretation of learned features. Here, we introduce a suite of computational tools that implement {NMF} and provide methods for accurate and clear biological interpretation and analysis. A generalized discussion of {NMF} covering its benefits, limitations and open questions is followed by four procedures for the Bayesian {NMF} algorithm Coordinated Gene Activity across Pattern Subsets ({CoGAPS}). Each procedure will demonstrate {NMF} analysis to quantify cell state transitions in a public domain single-cell {RNA}-sequencing dataset. The first demonstrates {PyCoGAPS}, our new Python implementation that enhances runtime for large datasets, and the second allows its deployment in Docker. The third procedure steps through the same single-cell {NMF} analysis using our R {CoGAPS} interface. The fourth introduces a beginner-friendly {CoGAPS} platform using {GenePattern} Notebook, aimed at users with a working conceptual knowledge of data analysis but without a basic proficiency in the R or Python programming language. We also constructed a user-facing website to serve as a central repository for information and instructional materials about {CoGAPS} and its application programming interfaces. The expected timing to setup the packages and conduct a test run is around 15 min, and an additional 30 min to conduct analyses on a precomputed result. The expected runtime on the user’s desired dataset can vary from hours to days depending on factors such as dataset size or input parameters.},

While the exact mechanisms contributing to substance use in schizophrenia are not known, a number of theories have been put forward to explain the basis of the co-occurrence of these disorders. We propose here a unifying hypothesis that combines recent evidence from epidemiological and genetic association studies with brain imaging and pre-clinical studies to provide an updated formulation regarding the basis of substance use in patients with schizophrenia. We suggest that the genetic determinants of risk for schizophrenia (especially within neural systems that contribute to the risk for both psychosis and addiction) make patients vulnerable to substance use. Since this vulnerability may arise prior to the appearance of psychotic symptoms, an increased use of substances in adolescence may both enhance the risk for developing a later substance use disorder, and also serve as an additional risk factor for the appearance of psychotic symptoms. Future studies that assess brain circuitry in a prospective longitudinal manner during adolescence prior to the appearance of psychotic symptoms could shed further light on the mechanistic underpinnings of these co-occurring disorders while identifying potential points of intervention for these difficult-to-treat co-occurring disorders.},

	abstract = {Association analysis using admixed populations imposes challenges and opportunities for disease mapping. By developing some explicit results for the variance of an allele of interest conditional on either local or global ancestry and by simulation of recently admixed genomes we evaluate power and false-positive rates under a variety of scenarios concerning linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) and the presence of unmeasured variants. Pairwise {LD} patterns were compared between admixed and nonadmixed populations using the {HapMap} phase 3 data. Based on the above, we showed that as follows: For causal variants with similar effect size in all populations, power is generally higher in a study using admixed population than using nonadmixed population, especially for highly differentiated {SNPs}. This gain of power is achieved with adjustment of global ancestry, which completely removes any cross-chromosome inflation of type I error rates, and addresses much of the intrachromosome inflation. If reliably estimated, adjusting for local ancestry precisely recovers the localization that could have been achieved in a stratified analysis of source populations. Improved localization is most evident for highly differentiated {SNPs}; however, the advantage of higher power is lost on exactly the same differentiated {SNPs}. In the real admixed populations such as African Americans and Latinos, the expansion of {LD} is not as dramatic as in our simulation. While adjustment for global ancestry is required prior to announcing a novel association seen in an admixed population, local ancestry adjustment may best be regarded as a localization tool not strictly required for discovery purposes.},

A useful methodological framework for this purpose {isF}-statistics that measure shared genetic drift between sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between populations. This article provides context from phylogenetic and population genetic theory. I review how F-statistics can be interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under different models of population structure and show how population substructure complicates inference. The results lead to simplified estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replace F3 with the average number of pairwise differences for estimating population divergence.},

Statistical-analysis programs for admixture mapping are now available, and a genomewide panel of markers for admixture mapping in populations formed by West African-European admixture has been assembled. Some of the remaining technical challenges include the ability to ensure that the statistical methods are robust and to develop marker panels for other admixed populations.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) are primarily conducted in single-ancestry settings. The low transferability of results has limited our understanding of human genetic architecture across a range of complex traits. In contrast to homogeneous populations, admixed populations provide an opportunity to capture genetic architecture contributed from multiple source populations and thus improve statistical power. Here, we provide a mechanistic simulation framework to investigate the statistical power and transferability of {GWAS} under directional polygenic selection or varying divergence. We focus on a two-way admixed population and show that {GWAS} in admixed populations can be enriched for power in discovery by up to 2-fold compared to the ancestral populations under similar sample size. Moreover, higher accuracy of cross-population polygenic score estimates is also observed if variants and weights are trained in the admixed group rather than in the ancestral groups. Common variant associations are also more likely to replicate if first discovered in the admixed group and then transferred to an ancestral population, than the other way around (across 50 iterations with 1,000 causal {SNPs}, training on 10,000 individuals, testing on 1,000 in each population, p = 3.78e-6, 6.19e-101, ∼0 for {FST} = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, respectively). While some of these {FST} values may appear extreme, we demonstrate that they are found across the entire phenome in the {GWAS} catalog. This framework demonstrates that investigation of admixed populations harbors significant advantages over {GWAS} in single-ancestry cohorts for uncovering the genetic architecture of traits and will improve downstream applications such as personalized medicine across diverse populations.},

Here, we examine pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants that were identified in the All of Us cohort. The European ancestry subgroup showed the highest overall rate of pathogenic variation, with 2.26\% of participants having a pathogenic variant. Other ancestry groups had lower rates of pathogenic variation, including 1.62\% for the African ancestry group and 1.32\% in the Latino/Admixed American ancestry group. Pathogenic variants were most frequently observed in genes related to Breast/Ovarian Cancer or Hypercholesterolemia. Variant frequencies in many genes were consistent with the data from the public {gnomAD} database, with some notable exceptions resolved using {gnomAD} subsets. Differences in pathogenic variant frequency observed between ancestral groups generally indicate biases of ascertainment of knowledge about those variants, but some deviations may be indicative of differences in disease prevalence.

To help understand cell type composition using gene expression data, methods of estimating (deconvolving) cell type proportions have been developed.

{RESULTS}: We propose dtangle, a new cell type deconvolution method. dtangle works on a range of {DNA} microarray and bulk {RNA}-seq platforms. It estimates cell type proportions using publicly available, often cross-platform, reference data. We evaluate dtangle on 11 benchmark datasets showing that dtangle is competitive with published deconvolution methods, is robust to outliers and selection of tuning parameters, and is fast. As a case study, we investigate the human immune response to Lyme disease. dtangle's estimates reveal a temporal trend consistent with previous findings and are important covariates for {DEA} across disease status.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Studies are increasingly examining the relationship between the neighborhood environment and cognitive decline; yet, few have investigated associations between multiple neighborhood features and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias ({ADRD}).
{OBJECTIVE}: We investigated the relationship between neighborhood features and {ADRD} cumulative incidence from 2010 to 2014 in the South Carolina Alzheimer's Disease Registry ({SCADR}).
{METHODS}: Diagnosed {ADRD} cases ≥50 years of age were ascertained from the {SCADR} by {ZIP} code and census tract. Neighborhood features from multiple secondary sources included poverty, air pollution [particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less ({PM}2.5)], and rurality at the census-tract level and access to healthy food, recreation facilities, and diabetes screening at the county level. In addition to using Poisson generalized linear regression to estimate {ADRD} incident rate ratios ({IRR}) with 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}), we applied integrated nested Laplace approximations and stochastic partial differential equations ({INLA}-{SPDE}) to address disparate spatial scales. We estimated associations between neighborhood features and {ADRD} cumulative incidence.
{RESULTS}: The average annual {ADRD} cumulative incidence was 690 per 100,000 people per census tract (95\% {CI}: 660, 710). The analysis was limited to 98\% of census tracts with a population ≥50 years old (i.e., 1,081 of 1,103). The average percent of families living below the federal poverty line per census tract was 18.8\%, and ∼20\% of census tracts were considered rural. The average percent of households with limited access to healthy food was 6.4\%. In adjusted models, every 5μg/m3) increase of {PM}2.5 was associated with 65\% higher {ADRD} cumulative incidence ({IRR}=1.65; 95\% {CI}: 1.30, 2.09), where {PM}2.5 at or below 12 μg/m3 is considered healthy. Compared to large urban census tracts, rural and small urban tracts had 10\% ({IRR}=1.10; 95\% {CI}: 1.00, 1.23) and 5\% ({IRR}=1.05; 95\% {CI}: 0.96, 1.16) higher {ADRD}, respectively. For every percent increase of the county population with limited access to healthy food, {ADRD} was 2\% higher ({IRR}=1.02; 95\% {CI}: 1.01, 1.04).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Neighborhood environment features, such as higher air pollution levels, were associated with higher neighborhood {ADRD} incidence. The {INLA}-{SPDE} method could have broad applicability to data collected across disparate spatial scales. https://doi.org/10.1289/{EHP}13183.},

Histopathological, morphological, and cellular studies revealed how multiple cellular changes are implicated in {AD} and {ADRD}, including synaptic damage, inflammatory responses, hormonal imbalance, mitochondrial abnormalities, and neuronal loss, in addition to the accumulation of amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau in the brain. The contributions of race, ethnicity, location and socioeconomic status all have a significant impact on the care and support services available to dementia patients. Furthermore, disparities in health care are entangled with social, economic, and environmental variables that perpetuate disadvantages among different groups, particularly African Americans. As such, it remains important to understand how various racial and ethnic groups perceive, access, and experience health care. Considering that the mounting data shows {AA} may be more susceptible to {AD} than white people, the demographic transition creates significant hurdles in providing adequate care from family caregivers.

              Key findings include accumulating evidence that minoritized populations are less likely to receive an accurate and timely diagnosis, be prescribed anti‐dementia medications, and use hospice care, and more likely to have a higher risk of hospitalization and receive more aggressive life‐sustaining treatment at the end‐of‐life.
            
            
              {DISCUSSION}
              Future studies need to examine underlying processes and develop interventions to reduce disparities while also being more broadly inclusive of diverse populations.},

	abstract = {Deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain is closely associated with Alzheimer disease ({AD}). Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein ({APP}) by the actions of β- and γ-secretases. In addition to Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma, deposition of Aβ in cerebral vessel walls, termed cerebral amyloid angiopathy, is observed in more than 80\% of {AD} individuals. The mechanism for how Aβ accumulates in blood vessels remains largely unknown. In the present study, we show that brain endothelial cells expressed {APP}770, a differently spliced {APP} {mRNA} isoform from neuronal {APP}695, and produced Aβ40 and Aβ42. Furthermore, we found that the endothelial {APP}770 had sialylated core 1 type O-glycans. Interestingly, Ο-glycosylated {APP}770 was preferentially processed by both α- and β-cleavage and secreted into the media, suggesting that O-glycosylation and {APP} processing involved related pathways. By immunostaining human brain sections with an anti-{APP}770 antibody, we found that {APP}770 was expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Because we were able to detect O-glycosylated {sAPP}770β in human cerebrospinal fluid, this unique soluble {APP}770β has the potential to serve as a marker for cortical dementias such as {AD} and vascular dementia.},

	abstract = {Cerebrovascular homeostasis is maintained by the blood-brain barrier ({BBB}), a highly selective structure that separates the peripheral blood circulation from the brain and protects the central nervous system ({CNS}). Dysregulation of {BBB} function is the precursor of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy ({CAA}), both related to β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation and deposition. The origin of {BBB} dysfunction before and/or during {CAA} and {AD} onset is not known. Several studies raise the possibility that vascular dysfunction could be an early step in these diseases and could even precede significant Aβ deposition. Though accumulation of neuron-derived Aβ peptides is considered the primary influence driving {AD} and {CAA} pathogenesis, recent studies highlighted the importance of the physiological role of the β-amyloid precursor protein ({APP}) in endothelial cell homeostasis, suggesting a potential role of this protein in maintaining vascular stability. In this review, we will discuss the physiological function of {APP} and its cleavage products in the vascular endothelium. We further suggest how loss of {APP} homeostatic regulation in the brain vasculature could lead toward pathological outcomes in neurodegenerative disorders.},

            Characterizing the transcriptome of individual cells is fundamental to understanding complex biological systems. We describe a droplet-based system that enables 3′ {mRNA} counting of tens of thousands of single cells per sample. Cell encapsulation, of up to 8 samples at a time, takes place in ∼6 min, with ∼50\% cell capture efficiency. To demonstrate the system’s technical performance, we collected transcriptome data from ∼250k single cells across 29 samples. We validated the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic {RNAs}. We profiled 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells to demonstrate the system’s ability to characterize large immune populations. Finally, we used sequence variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor chimerism at single-cell resolution from bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from transplant patients.},

Here, we present Single-Cell Remover of Doublets (Scrublet), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge of cell multiplets.

First, we show how to use the web interface to browse and search for data of interest using relevant file annotations. We demonstrate how to learn more about the context surrounding the data, including diagnostic criteria and methodological details about sample preparation and data analysis. We present two primary ways to download data—using a web interface, and using a programmatic method that provides access using the command line. Finally, we show how to merge separate sources of metadata into a comprehensive file that contains factors and covariates necessary in downstream analyses. © 2020 The Authors.

Quantified alternative {PAS} transcripts refine cell identity analysis beyond gene expression, enriching information extracted from {scRNA}-seq data.

	abstract = {Sequence-to-function models that predict gene expression from genomic {DNA} sequence have proven valuable for many biological tasks, including understanding cis-regulatory syntax and interpreting non-coding genetic variants. However, current state-of-the-art models have been trained largely on bulk expression profiles from healthy tissues or cell lines, and have not learned the properties of precise cell types and states that are captured in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Thus, they lack the ability to perform these tasks at the resolution of specific cell types or states across diverse tissue and disease contexts. To address this gap, we present Decima, a model that predicts the cell type- and condition- specific expression of a gene from its surrounding {DNA} sequence. Decima is trained on single-cell or single-nucleus {RNA} sequencing data from over 22 million cells, and successfully predicts the cell type-specific expression of unseen genes based on their sequence alone. Here, we demonstrate Decima's ability to reveal the cis-regulatory mechanisms driving cell type-specific gene expression and its changes in disease, to predict non-coding variant effects at cell type resolution, and to design regulatory {DNA} elements with precisely tuned, context-specific functions.},

          Alternative splicing ({AS}) of pre-{mRNA} plays a crucial role in tissue-specific gene regulation, with disease implications due to splicing defects. Predicting and manipulating {AS} can therefore uncover new regulatory mechanisms and aid in therapeutics design. We introduce {TrASPr}+{BOS}, a generative {AI} model with Bayesian Optimization for predicting and designing {RNA} for tissue-specific splicing outcomes. {TrASPr} is a multi-transformer model that can handle different types of {AS} events and generalize to unseen cellular conditions. It then serves as an oracle, generating labeled data to train a Bayesian Optimization for Splicing ({BOS}) algorithm to design {RNA} for condition-specific splicing outcomes. We show {TrASPr}+{BOS} outperforms existing methods, enhancing tissue-specific {AUPRC} by up to 2.4 fold and capturing tissue-specific regulatory elements. We validate hundreds of predicted novel tissue-specific splicing variations and confirm new regulatory elements using {dCas}13. We envision {TrASPr}+{BOS} as a light yet accurate method researchers can probe or adopt for specific tasks.},

	abstract = {The genetic control of gene expression is a core component of human physiology. For the past several years, transcriptome-wide association studies have leveraged large datasets of linked genotype and {RNA} sequencing information to create a powerful gene-based test of association that has been used in dozens of studies. While numerous discoveries have been made, the populations in the training data are overwhelmingly of European descent, and little is known about the generalizability of these models to other populations. Here, we test for cross-population generalizability of gene expression prediction models using a dataset of African American individuals with {RNA}-Seq data in whole blood. We find that the default models trained in large datasets such as {GTEx} and {DGN} fare poorly in African Americans, with a notable reduction in prediction accuracy when compared to European Americans. We replicate these limitations in cross-population generalizability using the five populations in the {GEUVADIS} dataset. Via realistic simulations of both populations and gene expression, we show that accurate cross-population generalizability of transcriptome prediction only arises when {eQTL} architecture is substantially shared across populations. In contrast, models with non-identical {eQTLs} showed patterns similar to real-world data. Therefore, generating {RNA}-Seq data in diverse populations is a critical step towards multi-ethnic utility of gene expression prediction.},

	abstract = {One mechanism by which genetic factors influence complex traits and diseases is altering gene expression. Direct measurement of gene expression in relevant tissues is rarely tenable; however, genetically regulated gene expression ({GReX}) can be estimated using prediction models derived from large multi-omic datasets. These approaches have led to the discovery of many gene-trait associations, but whether models derived from predominantly European ancestry ({EA}) reference panels can map novel associations in ancestrally diverse populations remains unclear. We applied {PrediXcan} to impute {GReX} in 51,520 ancestrally diverse Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology ({PAGE}) participants (35\% African American, 45\% Hispanic/Latino, 10\% Asian, and 7\% Hawaiian) across 25 key cardiometabolic traits and relevant tissues to identify 102 novel associations. We then compared associations in {PAGE} to those in a random subset of 50,000 White British participants from {UK} Biobank ({UKBB}50k) for height and body mass index ({BMI}). We identified 517 associations across 47 tissues in {PAGE} but not {UKBB}50k, demonstrating the importance of diverse samples in identifying trait-associated {GReX}. We observed that variants used in {PrediXcan} models were either more or less differentiated across continental-level populations than matched-control variants depending on the specific population reflecting sampling bias. Additionally, variants from identified genes specific to either {PAGE} or {UKBB}50k analyses were more ancestrally differentiated than those in genes detected in both analyses, underlining the value of population-specific discoveries. This suggests that while {EA}-derived transcriptome imputation models can identify new associations in non-{EA} populations, models derived from closely matched reference panels may yield further insights.

Yet most of these studies have been centered on European populations, leading to a constrained understanding of population diversities and disease risks. To address this gap, we examined genotype and {RNA}-seq data from African Americans ({AA}, n = 158), Europeans ({EUR}, n = 408), and East Asians ({EAS}, n = 217). When comparing {eQTLs} between {EUR} and non-{EUR} populations, we observed concordant patterns of genetic regulatory effect, particularly in terms of the effect sizes of the {eQTLs}. However, 343,737 cis-{eQTLs} linked to 1,276 genes and 198,769 {SNPs} were found to be specific to non-{EUR} populations. Over 90\% of observed population differences in {eQTLs} could be traced back to differences in allele frequency. Furthermore, 35\% of these {eQTLs} were notably rare in the {EUR} population. Integrating brain {eQTLs} with {SCZ} signals from diverse populations, we observed a higher disease heritability enrichment of brain {eQTLs} in matched populations compared to mismatched ones. Prioritization analysis identified five risk genes ({SFXN}2, {VPS}37B, {DENR}, {FTCDNL}1, and {NT}5DC2) and three potential regulatory variants in known risk genes ({CNNM}2, {MTRFR}, and {MPHOSPH}9) that were missed in the {EUR} dataset. Our findings underscore that increasing genetic ancestral diversity is more efficient for power improvement than merely increasing the sample size within single-ancestry {eQTLs} datasets. Such a strategy will not only improve our understanding of the biological underpinnings of population structures but also pave the way for the identification of risk genes in {SCZ}.},

	abstract = {Gene imputation and {TWAS} have become a staple in the genomics medicine discovery space; helping to identify genes whose regulation effects may contribute to disease susceptibility. However, the cohorts on which these methods are built are overwhelmingly of European Ancestry. This means that the unique regulatory variation that exist in non-European populations, specifically African Ancestry populations, may not be included in the current models. Moreover, African Americans are an admixed population, with a mix of European and African segments within their genome. No gene imputation model thus far has incorporated the effect of local ancestry ({LA}) on gene expression imputation. As such, we created {LA}-{GEM} which was trained and tested on a cohort of 60 African American hepatocyte primary cultures. Uniquely, {LA}-{GEM} include local ancestry inference in its prediction of gene expression. We compared the performance of {LA}-{GEM} to {PrediXcan} trained the same dataset (with no inclusion of local ancestry) We were able to reliably predict the expression of 2559 genes (1326 in {LA}-{GEM} and 1236 in {PrediXcan}). Of these, 546 genes were unique to {LA}-{GEM}, including the {CYP}3A5 gene which is critical to drug metabolism. We conducted {TWAS} analysis on two African American clinical cohorts with pharmacogenomics phenotypic information to identity novel gene associations. In our {IWPC} warfarin cohort, we identified 17 transcriptome-wide significant hits. No gene reached are prespecified significance level in the clopidogrel cohort.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Microglia, the principle immune cells of the brain, play important roles in neuronal development, homeostatic function and neurodegenerative disease. Recent genetic studies have further highlighted the importance of microglia in neurodegeneration with the identification of disease risk polymorphisms in many microglial genes. To better understand the role of these genes in microglial biology and disease, we, and others, have developed methods to differentiate microglia from human induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs}). While the development of these methods has begun to enable important new studies of microglial biology, labs with little prior stem cell experience have sometimes found it challenging to adopt these complex protocols. Therefore, we have now developed a greatly simplified approach to generate large numbers of highly pure human microglia.
{RESULTS}: {iPSCs} are first differentiated toward a mesodermal, hematopoietic lineage using commercially available media. Highly pure populations of non-adherent {CD}43+ hematopoietic progenitors are then simply transferred to media that includes three key cytokines (M-{CSF}, {IL}-34, and {TGFβ}-1) that promote differentiation of homeostatic microglia. This updated approach avoids the prior requirement for hypoxic incubation, complex media formulation, {FACS} sorting, or co-culture, thereby significantly simplifying human microglial generation. To confirm that the resulting cells are equivalent to previously developed {iPSC}-microglia, we performed {RNA}-sequencing, functional testing, and transplantation studies. Our findings reveal that microglia generated via this simplified method are virtually identical to {iPS}-microglia produced via our previously published approach. To also determine whether a small molecule activator of {TGFβ} signaling ({IDE}1) can be used to replace recombinant {TGFβ}1, further reducing costs, we examined growth kinetics and the transcriptome of cells differentiated with {IDE}1. These data demonstrate that a microglial cell can indeed be produced using this alternative approach, although transcriptional differences do occur that should be considered.
{CONCLUSION}: We anticipate that this new and greatly simplified protocol will enable many interested labs, including those with little prior stem cell or flow cytometry experience, to generate and study human {iPS}-microglia. By combining this method with other advances such as {CRISPR}-gene editing and xenotransplantation, the field will continue to improve our understanding of microglial biology and their important roles in human development, homeostasis, and disease.},

	abstract = {Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, are crucial to proper development and maintenance of the {CNS}, and their involvement in numerous neurological disorders is increasingly being recognized. To improve our understanding of human microglial biology, we devised a chemically defined protocol to generate human microglia from pluripotent stem cells. Myeloid progenitors expressing {CD}14/{CX}3CR1 were generated within 30 days of differentiation from both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSCs}). Further differentiation of the progenitors resulted in ramified microglia with highly motile processes, expressing typical microglial markers. Analyses of gene expression and cytokine release showed close similarities between {iPSC}-derived ({iPSC}-{MG}) and human primary microglia as well as clear distinctions from macrophages. {iPSC}-{MG} were able to phagocytose and responded to {ADP} by producing intracellular Ca2+ transients, whereas macrophages lacked such response. The differentiation protocol was highly reproducible across several pluripotent stem cell lines.},

	abstract = {Microglia are increasingly implicated in brain pathology, particularly neurodegenerative disease, with many genes implicated in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and motor neuron disease expressed in microglia. There is, therefore, a need for authentic, efficient in vitro models to study human microglial pathological mechanisms. Microglia originate from the yolk sac as {MYB}-independent macrophages, migrating into the developing brain to complete differentiation. Here, we recapitulate microglial ontogeny by highly efficient differentiation of embryonic {MYB}-independent {iPSC}-derived macrophages then co-culture them with {iPSC}-derived cortical neurons. Co-cultures retain neuronal maturity and functionality for many weeks. Co-culture microglia express key microglia-specific markers and neurodegenerative disease-relevant genes, develop highly dynamic ramifications, and are phagocytic. Upon activation they become more ameboid, releasing multiple microglia-relevant cytokines. Importantly, co-culture microglia downregulate pathogen-response pathways, upregulate homeostatic function pathways, and promote a more anti-inflammatory and pro-remodeling cytokine response than corresponding monocultures, demonstrating that co-cultures are preferable for modeling authentic microglial physiology.},

	abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells ({iPSC}) have been generated from somatic cells by introducing reprogramming factors. Integration of foreign genes into the host genome is a technical hurdle for the clinical application. Here, we show that Sendai virus ({SeV}), an {RNA} virus and carries no risk of altering host genome, is an efficient solution for generating safe {iPSC}. Sendai-viral human {iPSC} expressed pluripotency genes, showed demethylation characteristic of reprogrammed cells. {SeV}-derived transgenes were decreased during cell division. Moreover, viruses were able to be easily removed by antibody-mediated negative selection utilizing cell surface marker {HN} that is expressed on {SeV}-infected cells. Viral-free {iPSC} differentiated to mature cells of the three embryonic germ layers in vivo and in vitro including beating cardiomyocytes, neurons, bone and pancreatic cells. Our data demonstrated that highly-efficient, non-integrating {SeV}-based vector system provides a critical solution for reprogramming somatic cells and will accelerate the clinical application.},

By use of convolutional neural networks, this system identifies promoters and distal regulatory elements and synthesizes their content to make effective gene expression predictions. We show that model predictions for the influence of genomic variants on gene expression align well to causal variants underlying {eQTLs} in human populations and can be useful for generating mechanistic hypotheses to enable fine mapping of disease loci.},

Existing methods trade off between input sequence length and prediction resolution, thereby limiting their modality scope and performance. We present {AlphaGenome}, which takes as input 1 megabase of {DNA} sequence and predicts thousands of functional genomic tracks up to single base pair resolution across diverse modalities – including gene expression, transcription initiation, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, chro- matin contact maps, splice site usage, and splice junction coordinates and strength.
